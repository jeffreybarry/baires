Mid-term elections are coming up quickly & if you live here then you can't escape the media blitz by all the politicians. 

Even today when I went to my RSS reader and opened up the San Francisco-based literary blog <a href="http://www.conversationalreading.com/">Conversational Reading</a> I came across an unexpected feed ad for Margarita Stolbizer. 

<img src="http://baires.elsur.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/stobizerad.jpg" alt="stobizer ad" title="stobizer ad" width="400" height="280" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-788" />

Obviously a targeted combination of georeferencing and Google's algorithm detecting that <em>Conversational Reading</em> does on occasion mention Argentine literature and, every now & then, include some Spanish-language excerpts, though not at all on this particular posting. Now, I'm wondering which Argentine political ad I will see next in my feed reader.
