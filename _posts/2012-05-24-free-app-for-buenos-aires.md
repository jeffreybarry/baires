To celebrate the long holiday weekend here in Argentina & the U.S. (as well as my return to blogging about Buenos Aires) the <a href="http://bit.ly/BA4dys">4 Days in Buenos Aires app</a> for iPhone is free for this weekend. 

And, if you're into apps, you'll definitely enjoy the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/recoleta-cemetery/id453770731?ls=1&mt=8">Recoleta Cemetery iPhone app</a>. You'll have to buy that one, but it's worthwhile.
