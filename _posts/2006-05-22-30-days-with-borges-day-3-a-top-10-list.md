My favorite stories by Borges keep changing, but here's a list of my top 10 at this moment (in chronological order):

<ol>
<li> TlÃ¶n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius 
</li><li> The Circular Ruins
</li><li> The Garden of Forking Paths
</li><li> Death and the Compass
</li><li> The Secret Miracle
</li><li> The South
</li><li> The Zahir
</li><li> The Writing of the God
</li><li> The Aleph
</li><li> The Book of Sand
</li></ol>

Many people know that I am a librarian and may be surprised that The Library of Babel is not on that list. It's a great story, but it's so well-known that I wanted to give it an honorary mention and make room for something else on the list. As I said, my favorites keep changing. Perhaps at the end of these thirty days I will have a new list.

In future postings I'm going to be writing about each of the stories I listed, as well as others.
