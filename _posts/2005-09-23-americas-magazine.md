Anyone interested in cultural and historical topics about Latin America should consider subscribing to the magazine published by the Organization of American States, <a href="http://www.americas.oas.org/default.html">Américas</a>. There are both English and Spanish editions of the magazine. I brought with me a large number of articles from it that are related to Argentina when I moved here. In future postings, I'll try to summarize some of them.
