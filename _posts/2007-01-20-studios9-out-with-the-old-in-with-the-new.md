Changes are underway at local TV station canal 9 after Mexican media mogul Angel Gonzalez (who now lives in Miami) brought 80% of the TV station.

I'm not sure if this was related to the sale or was a long-term plan but the former studios of Canal 9 overlooking Av 9 de Julio are to be demolished for a new apartment building.

<div style="width:180px;text-align:right;"><a href="http://beta.zooomr.com/photos/14048@Z01/658984/" title="Zooomr Photo Sharing :: Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.zooomr.com/images/658984_db1d176b13_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="studios9 buenos aires apartment" border="0" style="border:1px solid #000;" /></a></div>

Too bad they're not making more creative use  of this building, perhaps even just maintaining the facade and cupola. The replacement appears to be simply yet another, bland, generic apartment building.
