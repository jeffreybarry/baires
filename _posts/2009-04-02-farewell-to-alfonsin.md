This afternoon Ceci & I met up with Robert to stake out a spot on Av Callao to watch the funeral procession of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raul_Alfonsin">former President <strong>Raul Alfonsín</strong></a> .

After the procession many in the crowd flowed onto Av Callao to follow the coffin to <a href="http://www.recoletacemetery.com/">Recoleta Cemetery</a>, but we decided to take a side street and come up to the cemetery via calle Junín where we found the <strong>mounted honor guard lined up outside the cemetery walls</strong>.

We assumed that there was nothing else to see but we wandered up toward the cemetery anyway. Then we got swept into the surging crowd as an entourage surrounding Alfonsín's son moved towards the entrance of the cemetery.  Then Ceci & I got separated from Robert. Never saw him again. 

The police were pushing through trying to form a passage so that the coffin could make it to the cemetery. At this point I just held up the camera and turned on the recording mode as the flag-draped coffin moved by. Actually, for quite a while, the coffin just sat there. <strong>Not a very good video but definitely a typical Buenos Aires in-the-crowd moment. I love that! </strong> But, I later learned that while I was recording this video someone in that very packed crowd <strong>stole my wallet</strong>. Fortunately, I never carry much money or anything valuable in my wallet, so the theft doesn't bother me too much.

Perhaps the person with the best vantage point of the funeral was this dude in the crane.
