Finally went out today and took this photo of our apartment building in San Telmo. That's our apartment at the top.  The old doors and windows are wonderful.  The window on the right is the living room and the one on the left is the bedroom.

The front rooms are very noisy during the day due to all the bus traffic. The noise almost drove me crazy for the first few days, particularly since I tend to sleep more during the day than the night. Now, I don't notice it nearly as much. 

The top floor makes for a nice terrace that provides a  good sunny spot for relaxing.
