I just returned from my neighborhood Coto, the largest grocery store chain here in Argentina. The San Telmo store on Av Brasil has two TVs showing the Mundial, one back in the produce section and another in front of  the cashiers . 

As I was standing in line, all the other men in line suddenly turned their heads towards the TV. They were listening to play-by-play and turned just in time to see Togo scored a goal against South Korea. Smiles all around. Even the cashiers, who are mostly young women, seem to be enjoying it. I guess it makes ringing up groceries all day much more interesting.  The whole thing was a rather funny sight, particularly since the game was South Korea v Togo. 

I do have to admit that watching the Mundial is quite addictive. I'll be a soccer fan before this is all over. Now I need to go finish watching Togo.
