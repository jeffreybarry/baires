For weeks I've been waiting for a shipment of books from the U.S. Finally, today, a notice arrived and that meant a trip down to <em>Retiro </em>and the international post office. 

The most anticipated volume in this shipment, what I look forward to soaking in day after day, is the one thousand plus pages of Walter Benjamin's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674008022?ie=UTF8&tag=elsur-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0674008022">The Arcades Project</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=elsur-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0674008022" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. 

The entire book is simply snippets of Benjamin's readings and his thoughts, an almost blog-like composition that Benjamin crafted while sitting in the <em>Bibliotheque Nationale de France</em>. 

The work is <strong>a curious intersection of philosophy, urban planning, architecture, sociology, and literature</strong>. 

Benjamin was fascinated by the arcades, passageways, of Paris and the ways those structures transformed Parisian society in the mid-1800s.

<em>The Arcades Project</em> - just like any blog - is an unfinished work. Begun in 1927, Benjamin still hadn't completed the work by his <strong>death in 1940</strong>, a suicide at the French-Spanish border as he attempted to flee Nazi-occupied France. It's not clear what Benjamin's intended behind the many pages of notes that editors later comprised together to form <em>The Arcades Project</em>, possibly notes for another work or simply his own occupation with a variety of thoughts. Originally written in German and French, <strong>the English translation was not published until 1999</strong>.

Walter Benjamin was a great observer of urban culture. And in my own walks around Buenos Aires, I'm going to be lugging this volume (my edition is a 5 lb hardcover!) along some of my jaunts. It should make for fascinating reading and reflection while sipping coffee. I'm sure that it will <strong>not be the last book I will ever read</strong>. But, I probably could spend the remainder of my days perusing this volume. 

Besides, my book shipment also included W.G. Sebald's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811214133?ie=UTF8&tag=elsur-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0811214133">The Rings of Saturn</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=elsur-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0811214133" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and Malcolm Lowry's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061120154?ie=UTF8&tag=elsur-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0061120154">Under the Volcano</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=elsur-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0061120154" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.

<h2>An additional surprise</h2>

I bought this book used at a good price, the hardcover was no more expensive than a new paperback. But what I particularly like about buying used books is that they often come with an added surprise. And this one certainly did. I'll blog tomorrow about that.
