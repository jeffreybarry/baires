Just went into the kitchen to get some chocolate milk and looked out the sliding glass door. It's a very foggy morning here in Buenos Aires. Normally I can see well past the dome of the Congreso, 8 blocks away. But now visibility is around 3 blocks. That's still quite a lot. I remember my undergraduate days at Sewanee when the fog was so thick you could barely see beyond your own outstretched hand. ... yeah, I realize this post is totally irrelevant to anyone but it's 4:40 am and I'm still awake.....
