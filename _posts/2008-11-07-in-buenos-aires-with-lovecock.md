I enjoy reading travelogues about places all around the world, though there is a certain sameness to them all after a while. With Argentina's bicentennial approaching in 2010, I decided to reach back and examine an Englishman's account of living in Buenos Aires from the early 1800s: <strong>A Five Years' Residence in Buenos Ayres: during the years 1820 to 1825</strong>. If you want to read along, you can find the PDF over at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OvARNxpJF24C">Google Books</a>. 

The author is supposedly a guy named <strong>George Thomas Love</strong>. However, this authorship is disputed by an Argentine historian: Alejo B. Gonz치lez Gara&#241;o, who translated the book into Spanish. (If I'm not mistaken, Gonz치lez Gara&#241;o also was once the director of the <em>Museo Hist칩rico Nacional</em>). From the bibliographic records it looks like Gonz치lez Gara&#241;o wrote a prologue to the Spanish edition. That sounds interesting. I should find a copy, there are several floating around the city, and see what he had to say. However, he attributes the author of this work not to Love but to <strong>John Luccock</strong>, an Englishman who wrote several travel accounts in South America. 

So, was the author Love or Luccock? I don't know but in the spirit of blogging and contemporary travelogues on the Internet, I will simply refer to this mysterious man as <strong>Mr. Lovecock</strong>. 

Mr. Lovecock's impression of Buenos Aires... from page 156:

<blockquote>A person will not be long in Buenos Ayres without picking up acquaintances with its inhabitants; amongst whom are some very intelligent young men. I have sometimes thought it would give me pleasure to conduct one of them to England, to be - not exactly a Mentor (needing that myself), but a sort of escort to him in the modern Babylon, London.</blockquote>

Ah, throughout the city's history all good foreigners have picked up sexy Argentines. More of Mr. Lovecock's adventures in early Buenos Aires in subsequent postings....
