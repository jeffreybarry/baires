Here's an odd house that I encountered while wandering the streets one Saturday. I've seen a few other houses in Buenos Aires of this same style but was surprised to come cross this one on Av Pavón in San Cristóbal.

Speaking of  San Cristóbal I've also came across this little <a href="http://www.sancristobalweb.com.ar/imagenes.html">image gallery of photographs from San Cristóbal</a>. Not a particularly good presentation of the images but it's a start.
