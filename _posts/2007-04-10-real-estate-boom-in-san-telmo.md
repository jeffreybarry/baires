From all the signs hanging on the outside of buildings, this must be the time to sell in San Telmo. (I count 9 <em>for sale</em> signs in this photo). I just wish that someone would go ahead and buy all those buildings so that they can take down those <em>for sale</em> signs and return the streets to normal. All the signs are messing up everyone's photos of these lovely streets.

Actually, there's a building down the street from me on Av Caseros that was sold over six months ago and the "for sale/sold" signs are STILL hanging all over that building.  Enough!

Walking somewhere along Chile I came across this new stencil, imploring that San Telmo not become Palermo.

But I think that it's a lost cause. At least San Telmo has more interesting architecture than Palermo.
