Last Friday night we went with our friend Adriana to see <a href="http://www.fuerzabruta.net">FUERZABRUTA</a>. We had been intending to go since the show started in May but just now got around to it. The show is currently scheduled to last only a short time longer in Buenos Aires; the latest date I saw was through August 28 but I'm not sure if that's correct. So, if anyone who is in town this month and hasn't yet seen it, then I highly recommend that you go. 

FUERZABRUTA was created by one of the founders of <a href="http://www.delaguarda.com">de la Guarda</a>, so if you've seen <em>Villa Villa</em> then you will have some idea of what to expect. Indeed, if you've not seen <em>de la Guarda</em> then I highly suggest that you get over to Centro Cultural Recoleta for that one, too.  Ceci and I saw <em>de la Guarda</em> in New York back in February 2002, when NYC was a cheap vacation  post-9/11.  I hope that FUERZABRUTA has the same international success as <em>de la Guarda</em>. 

Like all good shows it's best if you don't know too much about what to expect before you see FUERZABRUTA so I'm not going to say much more.  It's a very innovative show that makes for a fun night out.

Be sure to take a look at the excellent web sites for both <a href="http://www.fuerzabruta.net">FUERZABRUTA</a> and <a href="http://www.delaguarda.com">de la Guarda</a>.
