I've not actually been away from Baires but have been away from this blog for more than a month. Just been hanging out not doing much of anything...lately I've been writing more on my more academic site, <a href="http://endlesshybrids.com/">Endless Hybrids</a>, which will be boring to anyone who is not interested in digital libraries or new media. But, I'm going to make an effort to write more Buenos Aires.
