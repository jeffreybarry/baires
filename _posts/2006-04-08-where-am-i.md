I've been away from the blog for almost a month even though a lot happened this past month. There was the 30 year anniversary of the beginnings of the dictatorship, my own anniversary of living in Buenos Aires, the President's campaign against buying beef, and other assorted items. 

But I only have a limited capacity for writing and I've spent March working on another writing project: the completion of the first draft of a novel that I started last year. If you're wondering, the novel is about a man in Buenos Aires who becomes obsessed with the mysterious death of his neighbor. 

I will try to blog more often now that the first draft is completed. But, now I'm working on the second draft and probably will be spending even more time writing than blogging, particularly since the novel is getting closer and closer to completion. But somehow I will try to fit the blog into my writing schedule. 

I've also am now spending very little time online, sometimes not logging in for several days at at time. And when I do, only for a few minutes to check email and a few other things. I started using the Internet in 1990 and this is the first time in 16 years that I've been away from it for a significant amount of time. And, I'm actually enjoying not being online!
