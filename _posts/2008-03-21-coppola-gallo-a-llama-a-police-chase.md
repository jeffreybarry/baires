About midday I headed over to my "office" (aka Bar Britanico) to edit a manuscript. At one point I start hearing a guy speaking in English at the table behind me. That's not very unusual considering all the tourists in San Telmo. The guy was conversing with a few others about various cinema topics. Somewhere along the way I heard the terms "moral ambiguity" and "acting". Eventually I turned around and realized that it was Francis Ford Coppola. 

Of course, everyone here in Buenos Aires knows that <a href="http://www.goodairs.com/2008/03/coppolas-house-has-parrilla.html">Coppola has been hanging around</a> the Argentine capital writing a screenplay, <a href="http://alivefrommymind.blogspot.com/2007/10/francis-ford-coppola-robbed-in-buenos.html">getting robbed</a>, and preparing for his new movie <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0964185/">Tetro</a></em>. I figured that I eventually would have my requisite Coppola sighting. 


<em>Enter <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/03/08/vincent-gallo-to-star-in-francis-ford-coppolas-tetro-javier-bardem-to-co-star/">Vincent Gallo</a></em>: I was sitting by the door and couldn't help but notice when a bearded, scruffy guy in black t-shirt swaggered in with an appearance that proclaimed "Yes, I am an actor" and joined Coppola's table.  

Over the next hour I kept hearing snippets of conversation between Coppola and Gallo while the other 4  people at their table (and everyone at surrounding tables) listened. Gallo, who has a very loud voice, asked Coppola about Dracula and Gary Oldman. Coppola threw in Uma Thurman's name. Gallo tossed out Christina Ricci and Buffalo 66, and so forth. Coppola returned with a "Brando said," which was drowned out by the noise. Gallo asked again, and Coppola repeated, "Brando said....". 

A man walked by the window with a llama. <em>Where are we, Peru?</em> 

I never heard what Brando said. 

I didn't recognize the other people at the table. I'm really not very good at celebrity sightings. The elegant brunette at the table may or may not have been Maribel VerdÃº. When I do a Google Image search on her name, most of the photos of her are nearly naked. Alas, I can't confirm that sighting. (This almost was as good as when I saw Farrah Fawcett sitting at an Sbarro's in the Miami airport.) 

A block away, on my way home from Britanico, I'm almost knocked down as I cross Av Caseros by a young, dark-skinned boy being chased by a policeman swinging a nightstick.
