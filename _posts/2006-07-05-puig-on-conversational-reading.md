Okay, the title of this post is a little misleading, sorry....literary blog <a href="http://esposito.typepad.com/con_read/2006/07/eternal_curse_o.html">Conversational Reading</a> recommends Manuel Puig's <strong>Eternal Curse on the Reader of These Pages</strong>: "this is an extremely Freudian book. The old man has son issues and the caretaker has father issues and, well, they're pretty Freudian." ..... that certainly sounds like it has the Buenos Aires influence!

I've not read the book but hear that it is pretty good. I know a porte&#241;a who gave the book to her mother for her birthday this past year. Hmmm, some psychoanalysis needed there? :-)

If you're not familiar with Puig, then you may want to browse the <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/manuel-puig/">overview of Puig</a> I wrote back in December.
