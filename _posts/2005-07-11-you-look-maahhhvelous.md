<img src="http://elsur.org/images/baires/billyfernando.jpg" alt="Billy Crystal as Fernando Lamas" align="right" />So, how did I not know until now that Fernando Lamas, that suave icon of bad TV acting in the 1970s was from Buenos Aires?  Of course, Lamas, who died in 1982, is mostly remembered for Billy Crystal's Saturday Night Live impersonation of him and the famous catchphrase "You look maahhhvelous"....now, I won't be able to get those words out of my head when walking through Barrio Norte.
