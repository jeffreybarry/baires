I came across this photo taken by <a href="http://www.yesterdayslife.com/photofront/tebis">Esteban Diacono</a> (who, BTW, has some great photos) the other day when I was <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/teban32/576169567/">browsing through Flickr</a>.  

But, I've seen this guy before late one Sunday night when Ceci and I were sitting in La Academia on Callao. He was dressed exactly the same but without the hat. Then he got up to leave and, with a flick of the wrist, out came the top hat! I hadn't seen him since, so it was a fun surprise to see this photo on Flickr. The guy looks like quite a character so I was just wondering if anyone knew his story.
