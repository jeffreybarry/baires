...at the computer. Actually, I've never been much to write at the keyboard (even though I'm an excellent typist). Anything thoughtful always meant pen to paper. I don't mind. I prefer the slow way of writing.

But it's a style that doesn't make for very good blogging...that tat tat tat of fingers against keys that signals the processor to emit pixels forming one shape or another on the monitor while concurrently encoding data strings for manipulation by scripts on a server. Where's my spontaneity?

When I'm at the PC I rather be working than blogging. There's something about freelance work that keeps you more focused than a salaried position. Besides, my best thoughts about Buenos Aires come while I'm out in the city. For those moments, which seemed to have been rare lately, I carry a small notebook and pen for scribbling thoughts, fragments that later form posts on this blog about Buenos Aires. 

...more posts to follow...I'm not stopping yet...

...for now, a photo for you...from the <em>mercado</em> in San Telmo...
