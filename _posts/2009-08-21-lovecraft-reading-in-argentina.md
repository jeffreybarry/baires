I ventured inside a bookstore on Av Las Heras and was surprised to see on the front table an unexpected set of fiction works: a 3 volume collection of <a href="http://www.hplovecraft.com/">stories by H.P. Lovecraft</a> (here in Spanish translation, of course). 

The front tables in bookstores are usually reserved for the books that are highly promoted. Actually, in the U.S. publishers often pay booksellers for that space, especially at the big chain stores. That might very well be true at the chains here, such as El Ateneo & CÃºspide. But I felt a bit of joy that a bookstore in Buenos Aires (or anyplace) featured Lovecraft so prominently.  

<em>Sidenote</em>: Yesterday, August 20 was the 119th anniversary of Lovecraft's birth.
