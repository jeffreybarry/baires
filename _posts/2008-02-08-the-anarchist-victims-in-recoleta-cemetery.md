Recoleta Cemetery is one of those places where you always learn something new and Robert's <a href="http://www.recoletacemetery.com">AfterLife</a> site gives a fresh dose of those creepy yet beautiful tombs. You really should be following that site if you're not already. 

Back in 2006 I wrote a post titled <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/terrorist-assassin-avenger/">terrorist, assasin, avenger</a>. As blogging goes, I've actually forgotten about that post even though the anarchist movement in Buenos Aires is one of my favorite topics of reading. The other day Robert asked if he could use part of that post to highlight the <a href="http://www.recoletacemetery.com/?p=120">tombs of the victims, Ramón Falcón & Juan Alberto Lartigau, located in a spectacular corner of Recoleta Cemetery</a>.
