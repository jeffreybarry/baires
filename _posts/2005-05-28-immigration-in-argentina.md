Looking around Buenos Aires it becomes obvious that not everyone here is of Spanish descent. That's not a new phenomenon, as Argentina has largely been a country of immigrants. In 1914 one-third of the population was foreign born. At that time, an additional 80% of the population was descended from immigrants that had arrived since 1850. The late 1800s constituted a major wave of immigration, mostly Italian and Spaniards, though Eastern Europeans as well as Turks, Lebanese, and Syrians arrived during that time also.
