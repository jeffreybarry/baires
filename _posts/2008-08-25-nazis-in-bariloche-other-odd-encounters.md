I had some time to kill this afternoon on Florida street so I wandered into a few bookstores. One of the most bizarre guidebooks to Argentina that caught my eye was titled <strong>Bariloche Nazi</strong>. Perhaps the highlight of the book is that it reveals the purported location of the Bariloche home of Adolph Hitler and Eva Braun after they escaped from post-World War II Germany..... Uh, yeah.   

That's not really the kind of thing I want to spend my money on...but on the topic of Nazis in Argentina, I do recommend  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1862075816?ie=UTF8&tag=elsur-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1862075816">The Real Odessa: Smuggling the Nazis to Peron's Argentina</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=elsur-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1862075816" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Okay, I'm trying to keep my posts to a fairly low word count...saving you, dear reader, precious reading time. So, my next <em>odd encounter</em> will be posted tomorrow.
