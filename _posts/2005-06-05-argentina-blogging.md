In this weekend's <strong>Ã‘</strong> there is an article about <a href="http://www.cultura.clarin.com/suplementos/cultura/2005/06/04/u-988739.htm">blogging in Argentina</a>. (<strong>Ã‘</strong> is the cultural and literary weekend  paper published by the Clarin news group).  One aspect mentioned is the explosion of photoblogs in Argentina. Indeed, we know many people here who have photo blogs, mostly over at the free service <a href="http://www.fotolog.net/">fotolog.net</a>. According to Ã‘, Argentina ranks third on the list of countries with most fotolog users (behind the U.S. & Brazil).

The article goes on to describe <em>Bloggocultura argentina</em> and provides a listing of the some of the most popular and oldest blogs in Argentina. (I'll be taking a look at those over the next few days and will let you know what I find interesting).
