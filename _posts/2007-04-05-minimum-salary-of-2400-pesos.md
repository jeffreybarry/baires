[Note the date on this post is from 2007.]

Everybody is grumbling about inflation in Buenos Aires these days.....painted on the corner of Brasil and Piedras is this demand for minimum salaries of 2,400 pesos. Somehow I think that there's more to this statement. (I missed the posters that also were on the street a few days earlier attempting to rationalize this statement). But I know very few people in Buenos Aires who are making 2,400 pesos a month.
