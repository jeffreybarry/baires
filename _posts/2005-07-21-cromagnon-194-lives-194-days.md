I was walking around Av de Mayo this afternoon when I noticed that this poster had sprung up around the downtown area. It's a poignant reminder about the lack of justice for the <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/cromagnon-memories-of-young-lives-lost/">194 lives lost in the Cromagnon fire</a>, 194 days ago.
