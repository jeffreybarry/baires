One of the things I don't like about working more these days is that it leaves little time for blogging or even reading the almost 400 blogs that I have in my bloglines. There are a lot of postings that I want to write about but just don't get around to it. So, I have a backlog of ideas and topics for blogging that might find their way here someday.

Meanwhile, I wanted to point out a couple of interesting posts that I saw elsewhere. The Magical Urbanism blog has some really great postings about urbanization and Buenos Aires. See the <a href="http://www.magicalurbanism.com/?p=149">cartoneros of Buenos Aires</a> and a <a href="http://www.magicalurbanism.com/?p=147">Monday afternoon at Argentina's largest landfill</a>. Then work your way back on that blog for some more intesting posts. 

Also, Paterna over at aguafuertes 2004 wrote recently about a topic that I need to write more about: the recent <a href="http://aguafuertes2004.blogspot.com/2006/10/y-lopez-no-aparece.html">disappearance of Jorge Julio López</a>.  Some highly questionable and politicized comments by Hebe de Bonafini, leader of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, were made about his disapperance. 

Last night while watching TV I saw an announcement of a march this evening by the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo and a splinter group of the Madres, the Madres de Plaza de Mayo Línea Fundadora. See the <a href="http://www.madresfundadoras.org.ar/opinion.shtml?x=57595">Línea Fundadora page announcing the march</a>. 

I'm to Av de Mayo to see what's happening....then it's off to the coast for a couple of days this weekend. I'll try to post next week about the march tonight.
