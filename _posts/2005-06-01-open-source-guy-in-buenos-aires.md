I was delighted to see <a href="http://www.marclaporte.com/tiki-view_blog.php?blogId=1">Marc Laporte's blog</a> of his new life in Buenos Aires. He's an open source web developer from Montreal.  The <a href="http://www.solar.org.ar/">open source software movement is growing  in Argentina</a>, particularly in Brazil. Marc is very active in the development of the <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/tiki/">Tiki content management system</a>.
