I ran across an interesting series of postings Michael Alvarez, a professor of political science at Cal Tech,  who observed last October's election in Argentina, particularly a pilot project for e-voting. It's an interesting series of readings:

<a href="http://electionupdates.caltech.edu/2005/10/initial-impressions-of-buenos-aires-e.html">Initial impressions of Buenos Aires e-voting pilot project: physical security</a> (I didn't realize until reading this about the  involvement of the military  in Argentine elections).

<a href="http://electionupdates.caltech.edu/2005/11/qualitative-evaluation-of-buenos-aires.html">Qualitative evaluation of Buenos Aires e-voting pilot project available</a>, includes a link to an 11 page report in PDF.

I went with Ceci last October when she voted. From what I saw, the voting process went very smoothly. Then again, in comparison, I remember voting with the now infamous punch card ballot  in south Florida during the  2000 election disaster and in 2004 with the e-voting devices where it seemed like most of the poll workers had no idea how the devices worked. South Florida is a place that really needs election observers!
