Following the student protests about the building conditions at the Escuela Normal Sarmiento, a city judge tonight ordered the school to be closed. The judge inspected the building and found that there were dangers of electrocution and fire. So, the students were right afterall. This news just hit the wires around 11pm tonight, so it will be interesting to see the reaction on Friday.
