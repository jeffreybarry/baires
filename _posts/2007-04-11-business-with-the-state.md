<em>Continuing with our look at the <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/imagine-a-clean-buenos-aires/">political posters for the upcoming city elections</a>....</em>

This has to be one of the oddest political posters around town. At first, I thought it was a pro-Macri poster with its big letters of "Vote Macri" but I was confused since I didn't know my Macris too well. Did Macri shave off his mustache? Did he lose it jumping over a pothole? 

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffbarry/25563091832/in/datetaken/" title="DSC05402"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1588/25563091832_6fded9b775.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="DSC05402"></a> 

Then it was pointed out to me that this photo is of Macri's father - Franco Macri, a local business tycoon with a dubious reputation.

The slogan underneath the photo says "Business with the state, that is" followed by the symbol for Macri's political party PRO.  The elder Macri made a lot of money from doing business with the state. The poster implies that a Macri government will be filled with corruption.

Then again, conservative business types might just be in full agreement that <em>business with the state</em> is the way to go.

Do political advertisements in Argentina have to include a statement as to who funded the ad? I don't think so but it would be very interesting to know in the cases of many the posters.

Oh, I almost forgot...as you see in the photo...someone added a derogatory statement over the posters of Macri...since this is a family blog, I'll leave the translation out.
