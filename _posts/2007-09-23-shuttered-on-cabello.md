Robert and I were walking around Palermo the other day and came across this nice old house with its window shuttered on Cabello. I'm not sure if someone is now living there or not but we commented that it's amazing that the house is still standing, just look at those two bland apartment buildings next to it (and the tall buildings behind it). Clearly, there must have been amazing houses on those properties once. We predict that one day this old house will be demolished for a new apartment building or maybe just for a parking lot. Perhaps not. Let's hope not. But, just in case, I'm sticking it in my <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/the-city-that-fades-away/">City that Fades Away</a> series.
