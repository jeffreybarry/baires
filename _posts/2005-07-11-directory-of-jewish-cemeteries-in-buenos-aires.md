AMIA, the Jewish Community Center of Buenos Aires, has an <a href="http://www.amia.org.ar/register/sepelio.aspx?sid=128">online database of grave locations for the four Jewish cemeteries</a> [<strong>update</strong>: this link is updated and now works again. ] in Buenos Aires: Berazategui, Ciudadela, Liniers, and Tablada. You can search by last name.  AMIA also provides <a href="http://www.amia.org.ar/content/article_detail.aspx?aid=115">directions and information</a> (in Spanish) for visiting each of the cemeteries.

<strike><strong>Update</strong>: AMIA has changed their web site, so the link to the online database of the cemeteries isn't working. I also couldn't find it on their new site. Perhaps they will add that back in the future. It was a good resource.</strike>

<strong>Update October 15, 2009</strong>: The <a href="http://www.amia.org.ar/register/sepelio.aspx?sid=128">link to the online database of  Jewish cemeteries in Buenos Aires</a> is now working again. 

I did update the link to the page with directions to each of the cemeteries, but that page - for now - is only in Spanish.
