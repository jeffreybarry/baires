Continuing my ongoing theme of <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/an-italian-builds-a-home-in-argentina/">Italian immigration to Argentina</a> I've come across a posting at the <a href="http://olivetreegenealogy.blogspot.com/">Olive Tree Genealogy blog</a> about an individual who has posted the <a href="http://olivetreegenealogy.blogspot.com/2007/03/passenger-list-of-ship-federico-from.html">passenger list of the ship Federico</a> that sailed from Genova, Italy to Buenos Aires in March 1961.

I'll be interested in hearing personal accounts of anyone who immigrated by ship from Italy to Buenos Aires. There must be a lot of interesting stories among those who made the journey.
