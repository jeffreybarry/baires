Saturday night we went to the park in Palermo to see <a href="http://www.mercedessosa.com.ar/">Mercedes Sosa</a> perform. It was a free concert on a nice summer night, so there was a huge crowd. It wasn't the Stones in Rio but it was still a lot of people. I've <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/feliz-cumpleanos-mercedes-sosa/">written before about Mercedes Sosa</a> where I talked about seeing her in Miami Beach a few years back. At that show I had a seat on about the 10th row; last night, it seemed like we were on about the  500th row.  But we really enjoyed it anyway.

She had a number of guests who came onstage to sing with her, including Diego Torres. But the big surprise of the night was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charly_Garc%C3%ADa">Charly Garc√≠a</a> who joined Mercedes Sosa towards the end of the concert for three songs.
