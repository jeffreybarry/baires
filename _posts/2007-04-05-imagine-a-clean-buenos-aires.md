It's political season again here in Buenos Aires with the city's elections just a couple months away. That means posters are popping up all over the city. Here's one from Daniel Filmus suggesting that a vote for him is a vote for a cleaner city.

I wonder if they only put that poster on the filthy streets...anyway, I suspect more people were noticing the Chat Phone posters surrounding it. More posters from all your favorite candidates coming soon.
