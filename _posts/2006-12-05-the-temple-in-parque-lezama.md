Towards the back of Parque Lezama, just before the park slopes down towards La Boca, is a  replica of a Greek temple that always has intrigued me. Whenever I walk by this part of the park I always think of the story <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/30-days-with-borges-day-14-the-circular-ruins/">The Circular Ruins</a> by Borges.

The city surrounded the temple with an iron fence that has been locked every time I've gone to the park. But, a few days ago I was passing through Parque Lezama and saw that the gate to the temple was unlocked. Fortunately I had my camera and wandered inside for a closer look.

I went back  yesterday  and the gate was again locked. I know nothing about the history of this particular structure or that the statues that line the walkway leading to it. If anyone has any information, please leave a comment.
