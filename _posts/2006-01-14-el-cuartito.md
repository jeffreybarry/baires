The other night we went to El Cuartito, one of the classic pizzerias in Buenos Aires. There are pizzerias all over the city. This was my first visit to El Cuartito. The place has a great old feel to it. It opened in 1934. It was good but we probably won't go back soon, just too many other pizza places to try but if you're in Barrio Norte then El Cuartito is worth a stop. It's at Talcahuano 937, just look for the large green neon sign out front.
