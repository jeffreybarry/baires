This post inaugurates a new category - On the bus - an occasional series of anecdotes from travels on the city buses.

<h3>Country Music</h3>
Growing up in a small town outside Nashville I often heard country music playing somewhere almost every day. No surprise that in Buenos Aires I've rarely heard country music. But today as I hopped aboard the #17 bus in Recoleta the driver was playing country music on the radio. I didn't even know there was a country music radio station in Buenos Aires. Unfortunately, it wasn't the traditional country sounds of George Jones or the edgier, hardly country, Johnny Cash but the twang of Brooks & Dunn or some other modern, commercialized country music act.

<h3>Empty then full</h3>
The #17 starts somewhere around Plaza Francia, so there's hardly any riders as it passes through Barrio Norte. But the bus fills up as it passes through downtown on the way to the southern parts of the city. Ultimately, the bus becomes jam packed as all those who must ride standing grasp the overhead rail.
