Ever since hearing that <a href="http://www.ndpublishing.com/books/AiraGhosts.html">New Directions Publishing was releasing an English translation</a> of CÃ©sar Aira's <em>Los Fantasmas</em> (<em>Ghosts</em>) in 2009, I've been searching Buenos Aires bookstores for a version of the Spanish edition. 

As with some of my <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/searching-for-galeano-in-the-bookstores-of-buenos-aires/">previous attempts in searching for a specific book in Spanish by a well-known author in Buenos Aires</a>, I have been without luck. No <em>Los Fantasmas</em>  by Aira to be found anywhere that I've seen.  Well, fortunately, there's plenty more Aira to keep me busy.

At least those of you in the U.S. are in luck and can look forward to encountering <em>Ghosts </em> soon. Here's a <a href="http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/argentina/airac4.htm">review by the folks at Complete Review</a>.
