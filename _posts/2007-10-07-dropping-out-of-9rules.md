At the end of 2006 <strong>Buenos Aires, City of Faded Elegance</strong> was accepted into the <a href="http://9rules.com/">9rules</a> blogging network. I felt very honored to be accepted into the 9rules network, which was known for quality content. 

Recently, 9rules changed the membership requirements to make participation in the 9rules members-only forum or the 9rules social networking feature mandatory for 9rules members. 

I took a walk around the barrio yesterday to think about this requirement and decided to no longer be a part of 9rules.  I've never been one to participate much in online forums or in social networking. <strong>I simply rather put that time and energy into writing posts for this blog.</strong> 

I wish 9rules the very best success in the future.
