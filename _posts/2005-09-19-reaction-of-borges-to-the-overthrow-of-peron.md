Borges had fostered an intense dislike for Perón for years. The latest biography of Borges ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/0143035568&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=elsur-20&amp;creative=9325">Borges: A Life</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=elsur-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0143035568" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />) recounts the story that the writer told about his reaction to the coup that toppled Perón:

<blockquote>
Borges immediately phoned his sister to break the news to his familly. Then he went out again; the entire population of the Barrio Norte seemed to have surged into the streets to celebrate the news of Perón's downfall. It was pouring rain, but no one minded - there were crowds everywhere, wandering about aimlessly, singing and shouting. Borges himself was deliriously happy and kept crying out "<em>Viva la patria!</em>" at the top of his voice. He ran into a girl he knew on calle Libertad, and by the time they had found their way back to the avenida Santa Fe, he was soaked to the skin and had lost his voice with all the shouting. "I remember the joy we felt; I remember that at that moment no one thought about themselves: their only thought was that the <em>patria</em> had been saved.(p.328)
</blockquote>

Unfortunately, Argentina didn't fare too well under its new government either and Borges' political optimism didn't last long. Yet, Borges himself benefited from Perón's downfall when, a few weeks later, Borges was named director of the National Library.
