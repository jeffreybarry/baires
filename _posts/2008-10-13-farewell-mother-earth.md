This goes into the category of <em>things you don't miss if you didn't ever know it was there</em>. 

For some time during my early visits to Parque Lezama I never noticed this wood sculpture near the park's entrance. Then one day I did and took this photo in 2005. Wrapping around the base are carved the words <em>Madre Tierra</em> followed by the name of the artist. Unfortunately, my photo from then doesn't show the full name of the sculptor.

Three years later, I was on one of my usual  peregrinations around Parque Lezama and sensed something was missing. I walked around and found a stump in the ground. The wood sculpture had been cut down.

You can see the stump there in the foreground. Perhaps there was a reason for it. The top of the sculpture was cracked and maybe it was removed to be repaired. I certainly hope that it was not an accidental cutting, the grounds crew getting too carried away as they trimmed the plantings behind the sculpture and just went about whacking away.
