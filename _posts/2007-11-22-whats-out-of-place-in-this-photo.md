Earlier this week I was giving Donald, a faithful blog reader and new friend from New York, a walking tour of Flores. We took the A line out to Caballito, then walked down Yerbal into Flores. Yerbal is one of my favorite streets in that area, filled with a number of nice homes as you can see in the photo below. That entire block is beautiful with one obvious exception. This is a good example for the <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/the-city-that-fades-away/">City that Fades Away</a> series.
