Perhaps my friends in Miami at the <a href="http://www.library.miami.edu/chc/">Cuban Heritage Collection</a> would be disappointed in me....yesterday while I was reading in Bar Britanico a deaf man, who sells pendants or stickers, came by my table ... the last time I saw him in the Britanico I had no extra cash ... I vowed to myself that I would buy from him the next time he came around ... whatever he was selling ... I expected something related to Boca Jrs or River football teams...rather, now, I have a set of Che Guevara stickers to adorn my belongings...
