One of my librarian friends back in the U.S. sent me a link to a project by the University of Chicago library: <a href="http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/maps/latam-cities/">Late 19th- and Early 20th-Century Latin American Cities</a>. Included are digital copies of 2 maps of Buenos Aires held by the University of Chicago Library's Map Collection.

Like all good online maps these days, these feature that nice zoom-and-pan tool.

This map shows two barrios, <strong>Villa Alvear</strong> and <strong>Villa Malcolm</strong>, that have since been re-named as parts of Palermo. Personally, I like the older names.

Since tango is not a part of my Buenos Aires experience (and I don't really wander around this part of the city too much), I didn't realize that there is a tango joint called <a href="http://tangoeleganceba.blogspot.com/2006/02/villa-malcolm-cordoba-and-serrano.html">Villa Malcom</a>. And here's some video of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCLQ2CjKHug">tango dancing at Villa Malcom</a>.

Colorful isn't it? Plaza Col√≥n looked very nice back in 1916. 

The map is quite extensive and covers the entire city, not just the downtown. Note the topographic contour lines showing the elevation.
