Our <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/a-house-near-the-sea/">house in Mar del Sur</a> is under renovation. We plan to move to the coast in December, right in time for the Argentine summer...yeah!

That means I only have a few more months to enjoy the city of Buenos Aires. Oh, I'll be back for visits...just six hours away by bus... but it may be a long time before I live here again. There's so much of Buenos Aires that I've still not seen...so many streets I want to re-visit...so much more to blog about. I'll try to do more blogging in these upcoming four months.
