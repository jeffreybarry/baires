<em>Part 42,748 in the <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/the-city-that-fades-away/">City that Fades Away</a> series.</em>

Yesterday I walked over to the Easy in Barracas to buy a lamp for my writing desk. On the way I came across this corner (Jovellanos and Villafa&#241;e) where a building had recently been demolished.

I was sad since I remembered taking the photo below just last month.

At the time I was concerned that the billboards around the house meant that it was going to be demolished. But then I thought, maybe the signs are just to keep people out. It looked like such a nice house.

From the city's map site I found this photo of the house from a few years back.
