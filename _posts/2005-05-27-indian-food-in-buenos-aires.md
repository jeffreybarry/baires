To celebrate Ceci's 32nd birthday, we went to one of the few (if not only) Indian restaurants in Buens Aires.  Located at CÃ³rdoba 3547 <strong>Katmandu</strong> is a very good restaurant, though on the expensive side. Actually, it's the most expensive meal we've had in BsAs, $76 pesos for a dinner for two, including wine.  I had the mutton vindaloo and Ceci had her usual Indian  plate of palak paneer.  The restaurant reminded us both a lot of our trip to India last year.
