The history of Yellow Fever in the 19th century is fascinating. The disease, whose cause and cure was unknown at the time, was feared throughout the Americas.  I have long been a student of the history of Yellow Fever since I lived in Norfolk, Virginia, which experienced its own calamitous outbreak in the 1800s.  Anyone doing a casual reading of Buenos Aires history quickly learns that the 1871 was a critical event in the city's history. It led the wealthy to flee San Telmo for the northern neighborhoods, giving cause to erect some of the city's most incredible architecture in Barrio Norte.  <a href="http://www.greywall.demon.co.uk/genealogy/yfever/">Learn more about the outbreak of 1871 Yellow Fever outbreak in Buenos Aires.</a>
