One of my favorite museums in Buenos Aires is the Museo de Arte Hispanoamericano Isaac Fernández Blanco. (That's a long name!) It's located at Suipacha 1422 and is definitely worth a visit. True to its name, the museum has a nice collection of colonial Spanish-American material which are displayed in a very nice setting within the house.

The ground floor has a mostly religious theme. So, if you're looking for that colonial feeling which you find in, say, Lima then this is the place to go in Buenos Aires. Be sure to wander down into the basement which also has an interesting assortment of domestic items used by upper class porte&#241;os of the day.

The museum regularly sponsors some very good photographic exhibitions. The photo exhibitions generally don't have anything to do with colonial Spanish-America but provide a good reason to make recurring visits to the museum. 

The house itself is worth a visit alone. But don't be fooled into thinking that this is actually a colonial house. It was built in 1921 by architect Martín Noel, but he didn't live in the main house. That belonged to his brother Carlos who was mayor of Buenos Aires from 1922 - 1927. Martín lived in the front part of the estate, the group of rooms that are part of the front wall. The brothers also had a famous neighbor that I'm going to mention in another post.
