Football is one of the most vital aspects of life for most men in Argentina. But I must admit that football in Argentina is a topic in which I only know the basics. Fortunately, <a href="http://pitchinvasion.net">Pitch Invasion</a>, a site devoted to "exploring football culture around the world" has prepared an <a href="http://pitchinvasion.net/blog/2008/02/14/argentinian-football-a-primer/">introduction to Argentine Football</a> that has a superb graphic (developed by <a href="http://billsportsmaps.com/?p=994">billsportsmaps.com</a>) for figuring out the colors and locations of the football clubs in Argentina.
