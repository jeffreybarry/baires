I came across a posting about riding the bus as one of the things that tourists don't do in Buenos Aires. I suspect that's true for the most part. I highly recommend that visitors <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/category/on-the-bus/">give the buses a chance</a>. 

But as everyone knows figuring out which bus to take is very confusing, but this post does a pretty good, illustrated job of <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~vbg/blog/archives/2007/04/things_tourists_do_not_do_el_c.html">explaining how to ride the bus in Buenos Aires</a>.
