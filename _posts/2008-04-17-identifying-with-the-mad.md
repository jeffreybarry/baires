What do you write about when you don't know what to write? Or, when you're filled with thoughts, each competing for attention, seeking expression?

I find myself falling back into reading about my favorite historical period, 1880 - 1930. The architecture of Buenos Aires is a vivid reminder of that age, but I'm more and more intrigued by another topic: <strong>criminality and mental illness in Buenos Aires, circa 1900</strong>. 

My reading list includes learning much more about José Ingenieros, one of the leading Argentine criminal  psychiatrists, and his mentor José María Ramos Mejia.  Along the way I need to re-read a lot of Horacio Quiroga, who did a very good job in his fiction of identifying with the mad. So, over the next few months will be the occasional post about the psychopathology of Buenos Aires a century ago. 

Meanwhile, here's a photo of a somewhat <a href="http://argentinastravel.com/2146/ba-blanketed-by-thick-smoke-from-burning-brush/">smoky</a> Parque Lezama.
