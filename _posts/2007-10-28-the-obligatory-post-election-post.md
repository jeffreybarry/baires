Not much to say about today's presidential election in Argentina, certainly no surprises. I don't have a problem with a Cristina presidency. Indeed, all the top three candidates - Cristina, Lavagna, Carri√≥ - seemed okay to me. I do have this theory that Cristina might give a further boost for tourism to Argentina just through the inevitable appearances she is likely to make on the E! channel based on her fashion sense.
