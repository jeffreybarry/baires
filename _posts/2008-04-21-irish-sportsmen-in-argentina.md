As someone with Irish ancestry (way, way back), I've written <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/the-irish-in-argentina/">a bit</a> before about <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/stumbling-across-the-irish/">Irish immigration</a> <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/son-of-an-irishman-in-buenos-aires/">to Argentina</a>. A great resource for this topic is the wonderful <a href="http://www.irlandeses.org/index.html">Irish Migration Studies in Latin America</a> (IMSLA). 

The latest issue of IMSLA, <a href="http://www.irlandeses.org/imsla0803.htm">Sporting Traditions in Latin America and Ireland</a>, focuses largely on Argentina. In his <a href="http://www.irlandeses.org/0803kennedya1.htm">introduction to the issue</a>, guest editor John Kennedy explains



<blockquote>As the articles in this journal demonstrate, the contribution of the Irish and subsequently Irish-Argentines to the sporting landscape was varied and wide-ranging. Many Irish people who worked for British-owned railways or businesses were either co-founders or members of the first sports institutions, initially cricket clubs and later football and rugby clubs. </blockquote>

 
Even if you don't have a strong interest in sports, there are a lot of fascinating historical insights about Buenos Aires and Argentina in these well-researched articles.
