Every time I look around there seems to be more and more art galleries in San Telmo, which simply adds to the overall number of art galleries in Buenos Aires. The other day I went into an art gallery on Defensa that is worth visiting: <a href="http://www.galeriamgiachetti.com.ar">galer√≠a de arte mercedes giachetti</a>. It's at Defensa 718 and is located in a very nice older building. 

It's a nice art gallery to visit and, if you go, be sure to take the staircase up to the first floor where the works by the art gallery owner Mercedes Giachetti are on display. Even if you don't like contemporary art, visiting the upper floor of the art gallery is a nice chance to see inside one of the older buildings on Defensa. 

Currently, there is a very good exhibition by <strong>Elvira Cosentino</strong> that runs till June 3, whose works I found rather appealing. 

I also noticed on Sunday that Defensa is now closed as far south as Garay. There's  a bit more activity on Sundays now taking place on the block of Defensa between Cochabamba and Garay with several shops having opened recently and there's even a <strong>tapas bar</strong>, plus one or two more restaurants. And, on the same block, is another cool gallery whose name, unfortunately I don't remember. (I'll have to go back and take note of it). Gee, in another year, Defensa probably will be closed all the way past Parque Lezama. 

Oh, and I was mentioning art....if you're interested in art in Argentina and Latin America then you certainly should be reading <a href="http://argentina.artealdia.com/">Arte al Dia</a>.

Okay, here ends this public service announcement and free advertising .... but, hey, I know a lot of visitors to my blog are looking for that kind of thing ... art galleries in San Telmo... so there you go.
