When we don't feel like going out to eat or cooking, we will have something delivered from the restaurant on the corner, Zoe's. It's an average restaurant, nothing special, but good food. Last night, we had two entrees (filet mignon & chicken breast) and sides for $18 pesos, around $6 US....now, that's a bargain.
