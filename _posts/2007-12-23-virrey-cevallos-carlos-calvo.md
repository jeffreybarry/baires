Here's a lovely building on the corner of Virrey Cevallos and Carlos Calvo in Constitución. All the doors are boarded and the building appears to be vacant. I came across an article in the Clarín archives from 1998 that indicates a bad history for this street corner, which evidently had seen a large share of drug dealing during the '90s and even the shooting death of a dealer.

But from my own observations this specific part of Constitución is much better than it was a decade ago. Ceci used to live just a block from this very corner back in 2003. On my visits that year from Miami I often was walking around this area and never noticed anything troublesome.

There's a lot of new real estate development along Virrey Cevallos. Let's hope this beautiful building does not fall victim to demolition.
