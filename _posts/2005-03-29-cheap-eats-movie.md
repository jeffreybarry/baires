First-run movie tickets at the Cinemark in trendy Puerto Madero is $6.75 pesos, about $2.50 in US dollars. Taxi runs about $7 pesos for about a 4 miles trip. After the movie, we ordered food delivered from the restaurant next door to our apt: two entrees, plus tip to the delivery boy, was $14 pesos (under $5 US) for grilled chicken, puree, and spinach raviolis.
