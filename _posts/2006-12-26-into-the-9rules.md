<a href="http://9rules.com/blog/" border="0"><img id="image262" src="http://baires.elsur.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/proudmember.gif" alt="proudmember.gif" align="right" /></a>Last week I received news that this blog has been accepted into the <a href="http://9rules.com/">9rules</a> network of weblogs. I'm very excited about that and consider it a big honor. 

I've long thought of <strong>9rules</strong> as the best source for blogs with really good content and am, indeed, proud to say that I'm now a member. If you're not familiar with  <strong>9rules</strong>, then swing over to  <a href="http://9rules.com/en/browse/">browse the 9rules sites</a>.


As my second year of blogging about Buenos Aires nears an end, I want to thank everyone who has been reading this site. I'm excited about the upcoming year. I have a long list of topics about Buenos Aires to write about, a couple of ideas for new series of postings, and more to share with you.
