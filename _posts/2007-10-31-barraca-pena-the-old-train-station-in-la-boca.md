Tucked down along the smelly river in La Boca is one of the oldest (or, dating from 1865, is it the oldest?) train stations in Buenos Aires, Barraca Pe&#241;a. If you're in the tourist center of La Boca, you'll need to walk a ways along the river before you find it. Alternatively, you might be able to just walk down the railroad tracks but  that may be more of an adventure than many of you want. Several sections of the tracks in La Boca are now remodeled with pedestrian walkways but I don't think it extends as far as the station yet.  

That fancy rail car is fitted for a cinema, hence the painting on the side.

The original wood structure (and I just reminded of how unusual it is to see a building in Buenos Aires made from wood) has been painted bright colors in keeping with the La Boca theme. Workmen still are fixing up parts of the interior. And, it seems, that a family is still living in part of the station? (That girl with the kid in the photo was another visitor to the station, not part of the family I heard watching TV in the back room).

That tent off to the side of the tracks is an exhibition of photos of the area from the late 1800s. Prototypes and drawings of plans to develop the area around the station are on display. I must say, however, that the quality of the exhibition is rather disappointing. Basically, it looks like a student project. I applaud the effort but it makes me wonder if the project is ever going to really materialize. Anyway, best of luck to this project. It's worth keeping an eye on.
