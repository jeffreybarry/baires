Following-up to the post about <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/changing-corners-in-san-telmo/">trendy stores coming into San Telmo</a>  is this photo of the words "This is not Palermo" scrawled on the wall of the new Puma store just off Defensa.

See a previous post about <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/real-estate-boom-in-san-telmo/">real estate in San Telmo</a> for a stencil on the same topic.

Meanwhile, also spotted in San Telmo was this scribble on a wall along Defensa with the reminder: Let's treat the tourists well.
