 In a comment to my last posting Robert mentioned the high rise towers being developed in Puerto Madero. For those of you who haven't been down to Puerto Madero recently here is a photo of the construction that is taking place.

As far as I know, these towers are apartments and not office buildings. That's a lot of expensive apartments. And I understand that more are in the planning stages. Honestly, I can't figure out who is going to live in all those places.
