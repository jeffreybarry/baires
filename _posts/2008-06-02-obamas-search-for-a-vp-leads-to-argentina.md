I don't like mixing politics with my blogs, though while prowling the Huffington Post (another thing I don't do too often) I came across this <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-kelly/barack-obamas-vice-presid_b_104332.html">analysis of possible vice-presidential candidates for Barack Obama</a>. 

<em>Somewhere out there a Hillary supporter is screaming, "But he doesn't yet have the nomination!"......true but soon...anyway, <strong>I voted for Obama</strong>.</em> 

Regardless, you really should read that analysis and the surprising recommendation for the perfect VP candidate. There's an Argentina connection...really...but you have to read to the end of the article.
