Long-time readers of this blog know that our Buenos Aires home was on the border of San Telmo and Barracas. But since last November we've been staying at a place in Recoleta. A short-term housesitting gig turned into a longer opportunity. It's one of those beautiful Recoleta apartments...an absolutely astonishing staircase.

Good to experience what it's like to live in  a different part of the city, but I have missed the edge of San Telmo and Barracas, particularly <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/late-saturday-afternoon-at-britanico/">Bar Britanico</a> and <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/just-another-afternoon-of-edits/">Hipop√≥tamo</a>. Around Recoleta I just can't find any good cafes with that type of character. All the places around Recoleta are too posh & modern for my tastes (and maybe that's just reflective of the neighborhood). Any recommendations?
