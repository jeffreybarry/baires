Till the end of the month (March 1, 2009) there's a little <a href="http://centroculturalrecoleta.org/ccr-sp/exposiciones/2009/01/13/buenos-aires-memoria-antigua-2%C2%AA-etapa/#more-126">photo exhibition at Centro Cultural Recoleta</a> that is worth viewing. Featured are photos of the city between 1870-1880.

Many of the photos were taken by Christiano Junior. You can view some of his works in the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Christiano_Junior">Wikimedia Commons</a>, which includes some of the photos in the current exhibition. 

Not included in this exhibition, but typical of Christiano Junior's works is this studio photo of a paperboy in Buenos Aires:
