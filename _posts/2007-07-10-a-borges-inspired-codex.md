While browsing around the Web today I came across <a href="http://www.chrismclaren.com/blog/2007/07/10/tlon-uqbar-orbis-tertius-orqwith-and-the-codex-seraphinianus/">this posting</a> about the <strong>Codex Seraphianus</strong>, a possibly Borges inspired encyclopedia of a foreign world described in an unknown language by an Italian architect of the name Luigi Serafini while living in a small apartment in Rome.

Is the codex the product of a consuming passion or does it hold some other secret? Well, while so many are <a href="http://americanlament.com/2007/07/06/the-secret-and-lies/">talking about Oprah</a> and <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&articleID=72C0E84D-E7F2-99DF-3D281803B61E675C&pageNumber=3&catID=2">studying <strong>The Secret</strong></a>, I for one, think that the real secret may rest within these pages, a world which <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cottoncandyhammer/sets/72157594263968563/">can be explored through Flickr</a>. 

In addition to Borges there is another connection to this city and the codex: Buenos Aires native <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/30-days-with-borges-day-2-alberto-manguel-reading-and-learning-from-borges/">Alberto Manguel</a> who was present at the <a href="http://www.fantasticmetropolis.com/i/codex/2/">discovery of the codex</a>.
