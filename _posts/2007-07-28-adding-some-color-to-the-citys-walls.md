Over the past week I've noticed some colorful figures sprouting up on the walls of San Telmo and Barracas.

Here's a couple of Web sites relating to the artwork: <a href="http://www.elodio.tk">www.elodio.tk</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/louisvoyage/">www.grolou.tk</a>, which actually redirects to a Flickr page with photos of all the murals. 

And while you can browse through the photos of the murals on Flickr you should really see it for yourself. The colors are very vibrant. If you're in Buenos Aires, then it's a very good excuse for wandering around Barracas.
