Over the last month as I've been walking down Defensa in San Telmo I've felt that something was different, something was missing, but I couldn't quite figure it out. Then I remembered that there was once an intriguing blue wall with some wonderful lettering on one street corner. Where did it go? Was I just missing it? I kept walking up and down Defensa trying to figure out the spot. Then I realized that there was this new Calma Chicha store in San Telmo with an exterior wall that suspiciously looked freshly painted.

Welcome to <strong>Palermo Telmo</strong> ..... Things change. That's the importance of photographs and documenting the city as it is now. I went through my own photo archive to see if I had a pic of the old corner. I always had intended to take a photo of it but evidently never did. But surely someone had done so. Thus I searched through Flickr for photos tagged San Telmo. After browsing more than 1,500 photos (!) I came across this photo. Thank you <a href="http://salim.virji.net/">Salim Virji</a> for noticing this mural.
