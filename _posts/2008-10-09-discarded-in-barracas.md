This falls into the <em>you never know what you'll find</em> on the streets of Buenos Aires category....a reel of magnetic tape, dated <strong>1983 - 1984</strong>, tossed out onto the curb with the trash.

<table style="width:auto;"><tr><td><a href="http://picasaweb.google.es/lh/photo/OXflyI1VkL5frsi3GSXB2A"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-u8DH2-HiJ2Y/SO54NcZO8nI/AAAAAAAAPoc/x9C-XnFEX9c/s2048-Ic42/DSC07862.JPG" /></a></td></tr></table>

We brought it home and added it to our growing collection of obsolete technology. What was the storage capacity of this thing...50 MB??
