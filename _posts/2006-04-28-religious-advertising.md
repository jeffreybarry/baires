Ever since I wrote the posting about Borges and Judas, then the one about Easter in Miramar, I'm seeing a lot of religious advertising on my blog ...I've not become a holy roller...it's from google's adsense. If you read through an RSS reader, then you're fortunate not to see it...evidently google's context-sensitive ads need a little finetuning. So, I'm adding any ads about Jesus and God to my filter block in adsense...the whole ad thing has been an experiment anyway...it's scarey the kind of ads that people place through google with titles like 'blood of god', 'do jews believe in jesus', 'garbling the gospel'...even more disturbing is that people actually look those sites. Being from Tennessee, I'm used to religious fanatics but I don't wan them advertising on my blog.
