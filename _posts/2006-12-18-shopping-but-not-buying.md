I was at Abasto yesterday and the mall was packed with people, which isn't surprising since it's just before Christmas. But then I noticed that very few people were carrying shopping bags. From a quick look around, it seems like only 10% of the people had any kind of shopping bag...as an indication that they had actually brought something at one of the stores. I wasn't sure what to make of this observation. Why be at the mall just before Christmas if you're not buying? Then again, I was there also without a shopping bag and didn't buy anything...just went there for a movie. And the movies were very full as usual on the weekend. Of course, I know that Argentines - even in the best economies - do not have the Xmas gift giving obsession of people in the U.S. Of course, I've not even started my own Xmas shopping yet. I'll go again in a few days and see if things are any different.
