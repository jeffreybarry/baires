Wow, a month has gone since I've last posted on this blog...a writing project has been keeping me away...it's hard to keep up with all my projects - writing on this and that, which all in some way are related to Buenos Aires. I promise to return to this blog with more posts and announcements about some of these mysterious writing projects that I occasionally refer to here. 

Meanwhile, for fans of my <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/30-things-to-do-when-visiting-buenos-aires/">30 things to do in Buenos Aires</a> list I want to remind people of a post from earlier this year about falling in love with Buenos Aires, a description of <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/how-to-fall-in-love-with-buenos-aires/">ten enjoyable ways to spend your days in Buenos Aires</a>.
