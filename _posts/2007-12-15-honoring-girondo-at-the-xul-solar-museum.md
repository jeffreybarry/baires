Finally, finally made it over to the Homage to Girondo at the Xul Solar Museum. Today is the last day of the two month exhibition, so if you didn't make it then you've missed it. 

On display were many examples of books by Oliverio Girondo, one of Argentina's most important poets of the 20th century. Books by his wife Norah Lange were also on display. Many of the items on display came from the collection of their niece Susana Lange. This year marked <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/girondo-40-years-after/">the 40th anniversary of Girondo's death</a>. 

Also on display were drawings by Girondo. He was definitely no artist, especially when showcased in the same room as the magnificent works by Xul Solar. It was interesting to see some of Girondo's drafts for cover designs of his books.

I've written before about the publicity of that book when I posted about <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/the-house-of-girondo/">the house on Suipacha where Girondo and Lange lived</a>.  Here is the cover of the book:



And below is the super-sized model for that cover, an object that later graced the entrance hallway of Girondo's house.
