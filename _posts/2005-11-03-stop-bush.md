There's  a lot of anti-Bush posters and graffiti going up all over town. Here's some of the posters I saw in San Telmo. It says "Mr. Bush, is this the democracy that you promised us?".

Robert has some good <a href="http://www.wrighton.com.ar/?p=254">anti-Bush graffiti over on his blog</a>. 

This morning I noticed that Bush's approval rating in the US is now only 37%.  But he's still going to be president until January 2009.
