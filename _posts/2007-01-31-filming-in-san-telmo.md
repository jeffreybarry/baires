Seems like more and more film crews are popping up in San Telmo. Whether they're for commercials or movies, I don't know. Coming back from <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/walrus-books/">Walrus Books</a> late Sunday afternoon we saw that the corner of a popular tourist hangout, Bar El Federal, had been transformed into a piece of London. 

We came across the site just as the final scene was being filmed. There's the black taxi from London and the actress in a hooded black outfit. Off to the left was a guy holding a water hose that produced the "rain".

And notice the fake street sign on the side of Bar El Federal as calle PerÃº momentarily became Peter Street, City of Westminster.
