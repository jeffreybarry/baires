Sitting at my desk today I've been hearing the voices of tango singers floating up towards my 7th floor balcony. With hundreds of other apartments visible from my window I assumed a neighbor had taken on a new obsession & had started a practice of playing the stereo extremely loud. Eventually a slight tone made me realize that this was no recording but live music. How I've not kept up with the happenings around town. The <a href="http://www.tangobuenosaires.gob.ar/festivalymundial12/web/es/index.html">annual tango festival</a> is taking place. A quick visit to the city's website revealed that the focus of today's events are at the amphitheater in Parque Centenario. The entrance to the theater is a direct line of sight from my balcony. If I didn't have some very pressing matters at work then I would hop over to the festival. Meanwhile, I'm listening to music from afar. It's quite enjoyable to have the sounds of live tango drifting into your Buenos Aires apartment.
