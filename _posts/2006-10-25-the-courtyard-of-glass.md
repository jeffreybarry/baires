One of the mysteries that I love about Buenos Aires is never knowing what is behind a building's facade. Earlier I mentioned the <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/windows-of-the-booksellers/">enchanting bookstores on Esmeralda</a>. Between Poema 20 and El Libro Frances is the door to an apartment building that appears to have a lovely courtyard.

Whenever I pass by this building, whether on a walk or on the 17 bus, I glance through the black iron grill of the doorway and wonder  what's inside. I recently learned that another well known BA blogger isn't shy about talking his way inside buildings (<em>you know who you are</em>). I'm not quite that   ingenious but recently Ceci and I were walking down Esmeralda when we noticed that the door to this building was slightly opened. So, we just decided to stroll inside, where some nice tiles line the entryway.

The building isn't spectacular by Buenos Aires standards but it has a nice appeal. The entry leads down to a small courtyard with several, almost hidden, staircases sneaking off to the upper floors.

Looking skyward provides the most striking aspect of the courtyard: the immense amounts of glass that looms overhead gives the fairly small courtyard a  refreshing feeling.

So now when I'm riding the 10 or the 17 bus from San Telmo to Recoleta, I no longer have to guess what waits behind the doors between those two bookstores on Esmeralda.
