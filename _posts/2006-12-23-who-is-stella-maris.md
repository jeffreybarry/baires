How did I not know this?

While wandering around the coast of Argentina I saw several buildings with the name <em>Stella Maris</em>. Earlier in the year in Miramar I saw a couple of apartment buildings with that name, <em>Stella Maris I</em> and <em>Stella Maris II</em>. In Claromecó I saw more buildings with that name. Heck, even around Constitución Plaza in Buenos Aires there is a building with the name <em>Stella Maris</em>. So, I started to ask around, "Who is Stella Maris?" No one could answer my question. Of course, I never thought to Google the name or thinking about the origin of the words. 

My thinking cap wasn't on. Somehow, I had it in my mind that Stella Maris must have been some faded Argentine movie actress, rather like <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirtha_Legrand">Mirtha Legrand</a>.

Well, I was way wrong. But, when we were down in Dunamar I was reading about the history of Claromecó and found my answer. <a href="http://www.stellamaris.net/ourlady.php?s=1">Stella Maris</a>, Latin for <em>star of the seas</em>, is the ancient term used by seafarers for the Virgin Mary. That explains why the term adorns so many buildings in seaside communities. (Obviously, I grew up Protestant in a land-locked state).

In Claromecó there used to be a grotto devoted to Stella Maris. While that grotto no longer exists, I did take this photo in a shrine to Our Lady of Lourdes that is on the outskirts of Claromecó.
