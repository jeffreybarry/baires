On their way to the party yesterday in Plaza de Mayo a number of buses came by the apartment. The photo shows a line of about  a dozen buses from Lomas de Zamora. <br />
<br />
There's some controversy about the event. It was clearly a pro-Kirchner political rally paid for by the government. Of course, the incumbent always has a lot of benefits.  <br />
<br />
According to the news, these bus trips for yesterday's event were subsidized by the government. <br />
<br />
Just to underscore that it was a political rally and not a celebration of the national holiday,  a large part of the crowd left just after Kirchner's speech and before two of Argentina's most well-known (and best) singers - Victor Heredia and Mercedes Sosa - performed. Evidently, it was time to get back on the bus.
