There's an exciting new community newspaper for the San Telmo neighborhood: <strong><a href="http://elsoldesantelmo.wordpress.com/">El Sol de San Telmo</a></strong>

The first issue came out this month and can be found at various places around San Telmo. Additionally, several of the articles can be found at the <a href="http://elsoldesantelmo.wordpress.com/">El Sol de San Telmo blog</a>. 



Usually, I don't have high regards for the free newspapers and booklets that I see distributed around here since the content is mostly glossy advertisements. But, I really enjoyed reading El Sol de San Telmo since it actually has a number of quality articles. The paper is clearly concerned about the barrio and is not just a vehicle for ads. 

The cover story of the current issue is a good examination of the issues involving the bus traffic through the historic district.  The paper is co-sponsoring a discussion tomorrow night on this very same topic and that should be very interesting. <a href="http://elsoldesantelmo.wordpress.com/2007/10/17/mesa-redonda-sobre-transito-en-el-casco-historico/">More information</a> for those interested in attending. 

<a href="http://elsoldesantelmo.wordpress.com">El Sol de San Telmo</a> is edited by Marcelo Ballv√©. On an unrelated topic Marcelo recently had a wonderful article on the NACLAnews site: <a href="http://news.nacla.org/2007/10/08/remembering-che-and-the-guevaras/">Remembering Che and the Guevaras</a>.
