One of my favorite characteristics of Buenos Aires are the many kiosks selling newspapers and magazines.  Unlike North America you cannot buy magazines in the bookstores. I'm sure some expats miss the leisurely free reading of magazines while lounging in the coffeshop of a Barnes &Noble but I always was one for buying my magazines and taking them home, anyway. Of course, there's not a lot of high-quality magazines to buy but that's always been true of magazine publishing anywhere.

Buenos Aires is well-known for its vibrant intellectual life and magazines played an important role in the early-twentieth-century development of the city's culture.  A large number of literary magazines appeared during this time, though most lasted only briefly and some only one or two issues. (Literary magazines  obviously are not known for being  profitable endeavors). Some of the titles include <em>Nosotros</em>, <em>Revista de America</em>, <em>El Mercurio de America</em>, <em>Ideas</em>, <em>El Grabado</em>, <em>Iniciales</em>,  <em>Proa</em>, <em>Martín Fierro</em>, and <em>Sur</em>, along with many others.  

<em>Nosotros</em> was the most important of the early literary journals. <em>Nosotros</em> first appeared 98 years ago, having its first issue on August 1, 1907. Its full title was <em>Nosotros: Revista mesual de letras, arte, historia, filosofia y ciencias sociales</em>. So, like most literary magazines, <em>Nosotros</em> wasn't just about literature but covered a range of intellectual thought. The  editors of <em>Nosotros</em> were Alfredo Bianchi and Roberto Giusti, both in their early twenties when they founded the publication. In typical Porte&#241;o fashion Bianchi and Giusti conceived the idea for <em>Nosotros</em> at  a cafe on Corrientes. 

While Bianchi and Giusti had socialist leanings, <em>Nosotros</em> was not considered a radical publication. Indeed, <em>Nosotros</em> utlimately became the voice of the cultural establishment in Buenos Aires during the first quarter of the century. Throughout its 393 issues <em>Nosotros</em> would publish the leading writers in Argentina including Alberto Gerchunoff, Roberto Payro, Manuel Galvez, Ricardo Rojas, among others. One of the lesser known writers to be published in <em>Nosotros</em> was Jorge Guillermo Borges, father of a boy who would eventually become a world famous writer. 

In the 1920s <em>Nosotros</em>, as the representative of  culture in Buenos Aires, came under attack from the new generation of writers. <em>Nosotros</em> ceased publication in 1943 after the death of Bianchi. 

In later posts I'll be examining some of the other magazines that came after <em>Nosotros</em> in more detail, particularly <em>Martín Fierro</em> and <em>Sur</em>. Taking its name from the José Hernándes poem, <em>Martín Fierro</em> was the major cultural magazine of the 1920s Buenos Aires whereas <em>Sur</em> would become the most important Argentine journal of the 20th century.
