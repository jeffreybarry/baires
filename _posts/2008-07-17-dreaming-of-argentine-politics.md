I stayed up till early morning watching the Argentine senate debate and subsequent vote on the agricultural <em>retenciones</em>. Since I generally stay awake till 3am anyway and I've always been a news junkie, not falling asleep wasn't difficult. Besides, it certainly was <strong>dramatic</strong>, finishing at 4:30am. 

The VP Cobos, who had to cast the deciding vote in a tie-breaker, definitely looked like he wanted to be anyplace but in that position. It's not often that a Vice President votes against his President, so the political fallout should be interesting to watch over the next few days. Of course, Argentina is a constitutional republic and not a parliamentary republic, so Cristina has several more years left as president. Next year's mid-term elections should be fascinating. Despite Argentina's checkered history of insurrections in the last century, the great thing about republics is that - over time - they survive political divides and unpopular presidents.

During this year's political crisis in Argentina I tried to stay away from blogging about politics, and work demands kept me away from Tuesday's massive demonstrations. Somehow, though, a part of me does wish that hundreds of thousands of people would gather in support of improved education, health care, or fighting prejudice and discrimination. (But that doesn't happen in my own country either, though Obama is turning out good crowds). Ultimately, politics does so much come down to economics.

<h2>The other night I had a dream</h2>

.....I had gone into the small grocery in my neighborhood...you know, one of those Chinese-managed <em>supermercados</em> all over Buenos Aires. I brought my bread, eggs, <em>salchichas</em>,  & Coke up to the counter. <strong>The cashier, rather than being Chinese, was Cristina  Fernández de Kirchner</strong>....she rang up the prices on the register, which all seemed much more expensive than my last visit to the market, and passed the items on down the counter to the <strong>bag boy</strong>, who <strong>turned out to be Néstor Kirchner</strong>....but as he sacked my groceries, <strong>Néstor kept breaking the eggs</strong>........I'll let that image sit with you for a moment...............for those readers who don't know... eggs, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=HUEVOS&defid=1450573"><em>huevos</em>, in Spanish has a double meaning</a>.

That's a true dream, seriously.....though I guess now it's Cobos who is doing some <em>egg breaking</em>.

So, if I'm dreaming about this, then <strong>what do Argentines dream?</strong>
