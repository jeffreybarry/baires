My personal recommendations (a tiny <strong>guidebook</strong>, if you will) for enjoying 4 perfect days in Buenos Aires:  also available <strong>as an app for iPhone</strong>. You also can use it on your iPod Touch or iPad.

So, take a look at my first app-based travel guide to Buenos Aires. 

It's amazing what you an get for a .99 cents, especially in Buenos Aires. And, hey, if you don't want the app then go spend those a buck on a cup of coffee over at my favorite place: Bar Brit√°nico. 

The app <strong>Buenos Aires in 4 Days</strong> is <a href="http://bit.ly/BA4dys">available on the iTunes app store.</a> 

<strong>This app is no longer available</strong>
