<em>...this post continues yesterday's <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/nazis-in-bariloche-other-odd-encounters/">odd encounters</a> in the bookstores along Florida street...</em>

Argentine writer <a href="http://quarterlyconversation.com/cesar-aira-how-i-became-a-nun">César Aira</a> never seems to struggle with the writer's block, facing the blank page. After all, he has written more than 50 books. Despite his prolific output, I'm having a difficult time finding a wide range of his works in Spanish here in Buenos Aires. (I'm reminded of my long, desperate search last year for a particular set of books by the Uruguayan <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/searching-for-galeano-in-the-bookstores-of-buenos-aires/">Eduardo Galeano</a>). 

When I go to search for Aira I'm finding only 2 or 3 titles on the bookstore shelves.  In one of the four hundred El Ateneo stores on Florida street, I pulled down a copy of Aira's novel <em>Embalse</em>. I almost purchased it but as I was flipping through the pages I noticed that several pages were blank...page 62 had no ink on the page. Further examination revealed even more pages in the book that were blank...The book was published by Emecé, a fairly large publisher in Argentina. I would think that their quality control would be a lot better. 

Then again, I partly wondered, considering Aira's often eccentric style, if the blank pages were intentional. But I decided it was just a printing error. Yet, I couldn't help to think of Italo Calvino's wonderful story that plays with the concept of a reader buying a book with a printing error, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679420258?ie=UTF8&tag=elsur-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0679420258">If on a Winter's Night a Traveler</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=elsur-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0679420258" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
