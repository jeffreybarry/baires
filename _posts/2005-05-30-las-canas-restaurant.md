Last night, Sunday, Ceci and I went out to eat dinner. We had finished off her 3 days of birthday celebrations on Saturday night with a party of friends, locro, and a lot of vino.  Sunday evening, we went out to eat early, about 8pm. So, the restaurants were just opening for dinner. I was in the mood for bife and we walked over to Av Corrientes, one of our favorites areas in town. Rather than going to one of our regular spots in that area (<em>Chiquilin</em> or <em>Palacio de Papas Fritas</em>), we tried calle Montevideo called <em>Las Ca&#241;as</em>, which is right across the street from <em>Pippo</em> and just half-a-block from <em>Chiquilin</em>. The meal was very good, though the restaurant had a slight touristy feel to it, but not too bad. However, at $44 pesos (US$15) for a dinner for two (w/o wine), we thought that it wasn't comparable to either <em>Chiquilin</em> or <em>Palacio de Papas Fritas</em>, neither of which are that much more expensive. Indeed, during the week, <em>Palacio de Papas Fritas</em> has a  nice set menu for $34 pesos. So, considering the options in this area, we doubt if we we will be back to Las Ca&#241;as.
