One of Argentina's greatest living writers, Ernesto Sabato, celebrates his 94th birthday today. (<em>I originally wrote this post in 2005. As Tom points out in the comments, Sabato was born in 1911, so in 2008 Sabato obviously is no longer 94...perhaps I should update this post every year...</em>).

Unfortunately, not many of his works translated into English are still in print. I don't understand that and hope that  new printings of his translated works will appear soon. The editions listed on Amazon.com are mostly for used items, though Barnes & Nobles online does have some new editions. Most highly recommended by Sabato is <strong>The Tunnel</strong>. 

Sabato was a physicist before turning to writing fiction. One of his most important roles came in the mid-1980s after the military dictatorship ended in Argentina and Sabato served as head of the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons. The Commission published the highly important work <a href="http://www.nuncamas.org/index.htm" target="_blank">Nunca Más</a>.  

In 1984 Ernesto Sabato received the Cervantes Prize. Awarded once a year, the Cervantes Prize honors the lifetime achievement of a writer in the Spanish language. 

If you're not familiar with Sabato, take some time to learn about him.
