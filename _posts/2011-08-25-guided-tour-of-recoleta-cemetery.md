Without a doubt, Recoleta Cemetery is the most enchanting spot in Buenos Aires. Even after dozens of visits I still discover a new aspect: a tomb gone unnoticed or the slant of light through stained glass. Indeed, the cemetery is different depending upon the time of day and weather. And there's all that history of Argentina represented among the dead.

Wandering the cemetery on one's own is always a pleasure. Back in 2007 I had the opportunity to take a tour of Recoleta Cemetery with Robert Wright, who led tours not just of the cemetery but elsewhere in the city. But Robert no longer provides those tours. Robert and I teamed together to form <a href="http://www.endlessmile.com">Endless Mile</a>, an initiative to create a set of digital guidebooks to Buenos Aires and other cities.

Our very first guide is to Recoleta Cemetery. Our <a href="http://bit.ly/qLQScn">guidebook to Recoleta Cemetery is available either as an app for iPhone &amp; iPod Touch</a>.

<a href="http://bit.ly/qLQScn" title="Buy Recoleta Cemetery app"><img src="http://baires.elsur.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/app_store.png" alt="Buy on the App Store" /></a>

<strong>This app is no longer available</strong>

With the Recoleta Cemetery app or e-book you will get a guided walking tour with insightful entries about the 25 most important tombs, along with over 70 color photos &amp; archival images. Plus, the fascinating history behind what happened to Eva Per√≥n's body is explained.

I wished I had this guidebook on my very fist visit to Recoleta Cemetery in 2003. But this guide is not just for taking a walking tour. It's also a vivid way to remember your visit &amp; share with others the extraordinary place that is Recoleta Cemetery.
