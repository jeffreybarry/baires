This spot should certainly find itself on Robert's upcoming map of Barracas. Way down at the corner of Montes de Oca and California is Bar El Progreso. A sign above the bar proudly states that it has been around since 1942. Sometimes I feel that I shouldn't blog about these places but this place is hardly any secret. El Progreso  is on the city's official list of notable bars. I was little surprised to find that it even has a Web site: <a href="http://www.barelprogreso.com.ar/">Bar El Progreso</a>.

El Progreso wasn't doing much business this past Saturday. Indeed, they were closing up just after 1pm. Siesta?

And like every good bar El Progreso has its own resident cat.
