Singer David Byrne  has been hanging out in Buenos Aires lately with the band La Portuaria. On his blog Bynre writes about  a <a href="http://journal.davidbyrne.com/2006/06/62206_buenos_ai.html">bike ride around Palermo</a>, <a href="http://journal.davidbyrne.com/2006/06/62306_la_portua.html">making a video with La Portuaria in Chacarita cemetery</a>, <a href="http://journal.davidbyrne.com/2006/06/62406_show_day.html">rehearsing with the band on the day that Argentina played Mexico in the the World Cup</a>,  and a <a href="http://journal.davidbyrne.com/2006/06/62806_bariloche.html">trip to Bariloche</a>.   Some interesting stuff!
