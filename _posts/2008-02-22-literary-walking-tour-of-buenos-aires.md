I don't know if anyone offers a literary walking tour of Buenos Aires, but if you read Spanish then you can grab a copy of <strong>Al pie de la letra: guía literaria de Buenos Aires</strong> by Alvaro Abós and create your own walking tour.

I bought this book a few years ago and have enjoyed it, dipping back into it time and time again. The book also has a wonderful design with many little line drawings.

Yesterday when I was browsing the bookstores on Corrientes, I noticed that <em>Librería Libertador</em> has copies of this book for just <strong>10 pesos</strong>. 

I was quite surprised to see this book there. This type of book should continue to sell and I noticed by checking online that it's still sold for 32 pesos elsewhere, so I'm not sure how it got into the discount bookstores unless this is an old edition. My edition is from 2005 but the material in this type of book doesn't really get dated. Anyway, if you're in town, like Argentine literature, & don't already have a copy, then you might want to swing by Corrientes. While you're there you will undoubtedly find other bargains. I left <em>Librería Libertador</em> with 7 books and 54 fewer pesos.
