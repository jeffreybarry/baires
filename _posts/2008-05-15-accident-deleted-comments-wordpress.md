Guess I'm still getting adjusted to the WordPress 2.5 admin interface (only fellow WordPress bloggers will understand)...<strong>I just accidentally deleted the last 25 comments from this blog</strong>. Damn. Sorry about that to those who left comments. 

I hate how the new admin dashboard interface displays the comments awaiting moderation in the same list as the approved comments. I've been too tempted to click on the <em>select all</em> button (like I do when I only go to the <em>awaiting moderation</em> screen). 

Anyway back to Buenos Aires posting soon....and even more frequent backups. I also should remember to be more awake when I moderate comments.
