I promise to get back to some postings about things other than the <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/the-city-that-fades-away/">city that fades away</a> series. (I have an upcoming set of posts about opera in Buenos Aires). But here's another place on Virrey Cevallos that I came across, this time in the corner of Constituci√≥n rather than <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/buenos-aires-real-estate-development-a-dream-city/">Monserrat</a>.

Okay, the building that it replaced (again courtesy of the <a href="http://mapa.buenosaires.gov.ar">city's mapping site</a>) was long neglected and the ground floor destroyed. What were they thinking? That ground floor looked like the entrance to a prison.

Certainly, demolition and building new was cheaper than attempting a restoration. Not only is it amazing at the rate that older structures are being torn down, it's astonishing at <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/eviction-protest-in-san-telmobarracas/">the many beautiful residences that have become low-income housing</a>.
