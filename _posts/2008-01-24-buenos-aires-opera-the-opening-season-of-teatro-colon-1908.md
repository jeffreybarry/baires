With the <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/the-closing-of-teatro-colon-a-history-of-opera-in-buenos-aires-part-1/">renovation of Teatro Colón</a> behind schedule, which shouldn't surprise anyone, the theater will not be ready for its 100th anniversary on May 25th. I also noticed that the Teatro Colón has a <a href="http://www.teatrocolon.org.ar">new web site</a>, much nicer than the older one (though as of today the new site is still lacking a lot of information).
