If you're not seen Comet McNaught, then you've missed a spectacular sight. I took a couple of photos Sunday night from the roof of our building but the photos are not great. The lights from the nearby Clar√≠n building are way too bright and there's not an interesting foreground. Also, the photos are really grainy but it gives you an idea of the size and brightness of the comet. Oh, how I wish to live in dark sky country.

For the story behind how the comet was first spotted late last year, see the home page of its namesake <a href="http://msowww.anu.edu.au/~rmn/C2006P1.htm">Rob McNaught</a> who spends his time in Australia searching the southern sky for asteroids and comets that pass close to earth.  There's some fascinating stuff on that site if you're at all interested in astronomy. Another history of the comet along with a spectacular photo from Australia on <a href="http://cometography.com/lcomets/2006p1.html">Gary W. Kronk's Cometography site</a>, including some images of the comet visible in broad daylight.
