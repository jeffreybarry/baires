This photo is of the entrance hallway to our building. This part is covered but when you go just beyond the door in the photo you entered into a part of the building that is opened to the sky.

Just beyond the door you can see the staircase up to our apartment on the top floor.  Eventually, I'll get around to putting up a photo of the <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/our-building/">exterior of the building</a>.
