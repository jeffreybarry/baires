I was wakened from a dream the other morning....Ceci and I were visiting a small gathering spot, some type of bar or cafe that our friend Nestor had recommended.....leave it to him to find such a place... Everything was cool...at one point, we learned that it was a popular hangout for Hugo Chavez....were we back in Venezuela?...I went outside for a moment and then saw a tank and another car pull up. I thought, "Surely they wouldn't attack a place with so many civilians." The driver of the car put down his peanut butter sandwich (in Venezuela?) and picked up the mic of a radio. I dashed through the doorway as shots were fired into the back of the building. Everyone inside scattered for cover. I saw Ceci run from the couch and hide in a trash can. I ran to her, but didn't fit inside the can. My hiding spot was a silver metal cabinet sitting nearby. I squeezed inside, fearing for my life. Everything became quiet except for a song, Nick Cave singing, "<strong>I don't need no crappy, long, complex novel about London.</strong>"

I thought to myself, in that defining moment of dream life "If only I make it through this, I can finish my novel and it doesn't need to be crappy, long, or complex."

Ceci then woke me up.
