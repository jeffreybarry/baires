Every visit to Recoleta Cemetery reveals a tomb, a statue, a plaque that I've not seen before. Just visiting the cemetery in the morning rather than afternoon creates an entirely different experience, the way the light enhances a stained glass window or throws shadows along the walkways. But every time I talk to <a href="http://www.wrighton.com.ar">Robert</a> I learn even more about the cemetery and see details that I never noticed. 

Robert has done a very nice map that provides an excellent tour of Recoleta Cemetery. Now, he's gone even further and created what I think is the definite guide to Recoleta Cemetery: <a href="http://www.recoletacemetery.com/"><em>AfterLife</em>, Documenting Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires</a>. 

Not only is it the best way to learn about Recoleta Cemetery but, as Robert says, it's a "new way of looking at Buenos Aires" since so much of the city's, even the country's, history is contained within that cemetery.
