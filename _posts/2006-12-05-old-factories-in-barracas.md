We went for an early morning walk around Barracas on Sunday, which is a great time to see the old factory buildings in that part of the city.

Just around the corner is the Alpargatas complex. (I'll have more photos of the Alpargatas buildings in another post). I particularly liked the  structure in the photo below. You can't tell in this photo but there are some nice balconies built into the upper two floors of the sides of this building. (Have to go back for another photo).
