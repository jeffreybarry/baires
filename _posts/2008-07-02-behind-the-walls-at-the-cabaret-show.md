<em>I'm really trying to post more often, after being mostly absent from this blog last month. But today, I've not even gotten out of the house. So I decided to scan through the tons of photos that I've been intending to post about....</em>

Early last month while walking down Azcuenaga street next to Recoleta Cemetery I saw <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/the-city-that-fades-away/">another building demolition</a> almost completed.

Particularly, I was intrigued by <strong>that window on the very back wall</strong>. I was half surprised that the demolition crew had enough sense not knock it out completely. I've not been back by that block in a few weeks, so I guess it's completely gone now, salvaged and sold off. I don't have a very good zoom on my little camera, so this is the best close-up I could get of the window.

As I often do when I encounter these demolished buildings, I started wondering about <strong>the building that was there before</strong>. Obviously, from the looks of this window it appears that the previous house must have been quite nice at one time, right?

A good resource to check photos for every parcel of land in Buenos Aires is the <a href="http://mapa.buenosaires.gov.ar">city's map site</a>. But guess what a photo from March 2007 showed was on this lot:

<strong>Cabaret show?</strong>...I really had to examine the photo closely to make sure that it was the same lot of land, but <em>yep </em>that appears to be the same place.....well, that strip of Azcuenaga is filled with clubs of a dubious nature. 

I always tell people that you <strong>never know what is behind the facade</strong> of buildings in Buenos Aires.  And this is a case where one certainly never knew what was behind the walls of the cabaret show.
