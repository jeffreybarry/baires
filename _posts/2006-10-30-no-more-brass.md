I was walking down the stairs of the apartment building the other day when one of the neighbors sighed and said that someone stole the brass handle to the front door.   I've  heard that happened a lot just after the economic crisis a few years back but didn't know that it was still common. Obviously, the Argentine economy is not improving for everyone. It's annoying but at least the thief didn't damage the lock mechanism in the process.
