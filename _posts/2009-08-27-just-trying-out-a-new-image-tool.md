Merely checking to see how <del datetime="2014-05-21T17:57:35+00:00">this picasa->lighbox plugin works</del>, this Flickr embed....BTW, this photo was taken very early one morning back in 2005 in the neighborhood of Once. For some reason, perhaps because I so clearly remember this early morning walk, this remains one of my favorite photos.
