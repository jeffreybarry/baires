In a recent post about the  Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, I mentioned the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo who are focused on identifying the children who are born in captivity or kidnapped with their parents during the last military dictatorship in Argentina. Recently, the Grandmothers announced that they had identified another missing child, which now brings the total to 82 children that they have recovered in their 27 years of searching.

An <a href="http://www.clarin.com/diario/2006/02/15/elpais/p-01001.htm">article in Clarín</a>, in Spanish, says that the identified child is now a man of 28 who goes by the name of Sebastián. His parents, Gaspar Casado and Adriana Tasca, disappeared in 1977 and he was born in captivity the following year. His parents are still missing. 

After his birth, the boy was given by an Army officer to another family. The family registered the boy as their own with the aid of doctor associated with the Buenos Aires police. 

As he grew older the boy had doubts about his identity and last year contacted the Grandmothers association by email. They established his identity and introduced him to his maternal grandmother. He recently received results of DNA analysis that proves the relationship.

As I've also mentioned several times on this blog, an excellent book about this subject is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0520215702&tag=elsur-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">Searching for Life: The Grandmothers of the Plaza De Mayo and the Disappeared Children of Argentina</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=elsur-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0520215702" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
