I was looking through my photos from this month and it took me a minute to realize where this corner was located. In my "walking tours" around Buenos Aires I see so many enchanting corners and often fail to note the exact location. Then I remembered that this was taken one Sunday afternoon after taking the subte to Caballito and walking down Yerbal towards Flores.

Paysandu is a charming little street. More photos from this walk to follow.
