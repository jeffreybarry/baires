Here's a <a href="http://www.findelmundo.com.ar/moblog/index.php">wonderful photo blog</a> that I wished I had discovered sooner, when it was still active. Gustavo Romano is an artist in Buenos Aires who photographed the contents of his pocket everyday for almost three years. 

Looking at the photos is quite addictive and provides an alternative visual memory of Buenos Aires (and other places that Gustavo visited during those years). Anyone who has spent anytime in Buenos Aires immediately will recognize many of the objects that cross our paths and find their way into our pockets everyday.
