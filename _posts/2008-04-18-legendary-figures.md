Who are the legendary figures of Buenos Aires? Obviously, Eva Peron is the most known (along with hubby Juan). Among those who read, Borges is legendary. Among those who dance tango, there's Gardel. 

Buenos Aires has great old architecture but are any of the architects of Buenos Aires really legendary, the likes of Louis Sullivan or Gaudí?

Actually, this really isn't about Buenos Aires. The main reason behind this post is to provide an opportunity to quote a passage from a novel by James Salter that I'm reading. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0141188634?ie=UTF8&tag=elsur-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0141188634">Light Years</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=elsur-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0141188634" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> (recently reissued by Penguin and with an introduction by Richard Ford) is about the marriage of Viri and Nedra. Viri is a New York architect:



<blockquote>He could not be Sullivan, he could not be Gaudí. Well, perhaps Gaudí, who lived to that old age which is sainthood, an ascetic old age, frail, slight, wandering the streets of Barcelona, unknown to its many inhabitants. In the end he was struck by a streetcar and left unattended. In the bareness and odor of the charity ward amid the children and poor relations a single eccentric life was ending, a life that was more clamorous than the sea, an everlasting life, a life which was easy to abandon since it was only a husk; it had already metamorphosed, escaped into buildings, cathedrals, legend.</blockquote>
