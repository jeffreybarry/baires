Casual conversations often lead to unexpected discoveries. The other day I walked over to Palermo to have coffee with Peter Robertson and talk about future plans for <a href="http://interlitq.org">The International Literary Quarterly</a> (<em>interlitq</em>). We had just finished releasing issue 7. Even though Peter and I both live in Buenos Aires, we edit and prepare each issue virtually via e-mail and transferring files around the net. So getting together to talk in person is a rare treat. 

Among the news Peter had for me was that <a href="http://www.alaindebotton.com/index.asp">Alain de Botton</a> was joining the board of consulting editors for <em>interlitq</em>. And since this is more or less a travel blog, I must mention that <strong>Alain de Botton's excellent book</strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375725342?ie=UTF8&tag=elsur-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0375725342"><strong>The Art of Travel</strong></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=elsur-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0375725342" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> <strong>should be read by all travelers. </strong>

<h2>Artists on Menorca</h2>
Speaking of traveling, Peter told me about a recent trip to the island of Menorca. When I lived in Miami Beach, I had a roommate from Menorca. (A shout out to Carmen wherever she may be today.) Anyway, Peter was on Menorca to to meet Kenneth Draper & Jean Macalpine, who will be guest artists for upcoming issues of <a href="http://interlitq.org/">interlitq</a>. I had to admit that I wasn't familiar with their artwork but after viewing the websites of <a href="http://www.kennethdraper.com/">Kenneth Draper</a> and <a href="http://www.jeanmacalpine.com/">Jean Macalpine</a> I'm delighted to become acquainted with this "new" discovery.

Draper's work is a wonderfully colorful collection of mixed media art and Macalpine creates fantastic hand toned photographs. You have to visit their websites: <a href="http://www.kennethdraper.com/">Kenneth Draper</a> and <a href="http://www.jeanmacalpine.com/">Jean Macalpine</a>. 

Peter sent along this photo of him with Draper in Menorca.

Draper is a very recognized artist. He is a <em>Royal Academician</em>, which is something quite important and evidently Brits know what the letters RA signify after a person's name, but most of us Americans are clueless about those initials. RA signifies that one is a member of the <a href="http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/academicians/">Royal Academy of Arts</a>, and <a href="http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/academicians/sculptors/ken-draper-ra,106,AR.html">Ken Draper has his own page on the Royal Academy site</a>. 

<strong>While Draper & Macalpine have exhibited in London, they regularly sell their work to international private clients, and are now keen to give exhibitions on the Iberian peninsula and thereby, through their art, transmit the unique and ravishing beauty of Menorca to those living on the Spanish mainland. </strong>

Keep your eyes on the <a href="http://interlitq.wordpress.com/">interlitq blog</a> for announcements about the upcoming issues of interlitq featuring the artwork of Kenneth Draper & Jean Macalpine. 

Now, Ceci & I just need to figure out how to work out a visit to Menorca into our travel plans.
