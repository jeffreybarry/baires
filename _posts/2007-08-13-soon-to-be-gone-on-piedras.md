This is why I started the <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/the-city-that-fades-away/">City that Fades Away series</a>. Architecture is one of the distinguishing aspects of Buenos Aires. I'm perplexed whenever characteristic structures are demolished for replacement by new, bland apartment buildings with such little sense of style.
