The North American Congress on Latin America (NACLA) has published a really good article on its site about a very worthy initiative: <a href="http://news.nacla.org/2007/05/07/children-of-disappeared-create-archive-of-identity/">Children of Disappeared Create Archive of Identity</a>. 



<blockquote>The Archive became a powerful tool to reconcile the grandchildren with their own history. Instead of accounts of tortures or reports on assassinations, the Archive collects personal stories, recounts life experiences, biographical accounts. In-depth interviews with friends and relatives of the ones who "disappeared&#8221; during the so-called "dirty war&#8221; and recordings of their stories allow the recovery of their memory while establishing a dialogue between past and present.

Monica Mu&#241;oz, one of the Archive coordinators, explains that there is a cultural heritage in the daily life of a family that parents pass instinctively to their children, a kind of chain. For the kids who were kidnapped, this chain was broken. The primary goal of the Archive is to help the youngsters when they are found to recover and reconstruct this chain and their own identity. </blockquote>
