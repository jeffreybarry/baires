Across Av Caseros from the <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/the-old-prison-on-caseros/">old prison</a> is a very nice park, Parque Ameghino. I'm very fond of the parks and plazas scattered through Buenos Aires, so I thought I would check this one out.

Just after entering the park I saw a small sign with a  brief history of the park. The park was originally the Cemeterio del Sur, which dates back to 1867. The next year 1,400 victims of the cholera epidemic were buried there. Just a few years later during the 1871 Yellow Fever epidemic more than 14,000 people who died from the disease were buried in the cemetery. 

A monument to the victims of Yellow Fever is at the center of the park. The monument has a nicely detailed scene.

On his <a href="http://parquedelospatricios.blogspot.com/2006/08/rastros-del-cementerio-del-sur-en-el.html">excellent blog dedicated to Parque Patricios</a> Gabriel has much more information (in Spanish) about Parque Ameghino, the monument, and the history of the cemetery. 

When I was at the park I kept wondering what happened to those that were buried there. Gabriel provides one clue and photo at the end of his posting that indicates the location of a small rise in the land in the park, which according to a local historian, is the spot of a common grave.

At some point I'm wanting to do more research into the <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/buenos-aires-the-1871-yellow-fever-epidemic/">Yellow Fever epidemic of 1871</a>. A few years ago I read a fascinating book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0801861969&tag=elsur-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">Yellow Fever and the South</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=elsur-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0801861969" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/>. That's the American South not South America. But I think an interesting book to research and write someday is an examination and comparison of 19th century Yellow Fever epidemics in both North and South America. There are surely some fascinating stories to uncover. Well, guess I just add that to my long list of things to do!
