Again on Wednesday evening several human rights groups led a march down Avenida de Mayo from Congreso to Plaza de Mayo to protest the disappearance of Jorge Julio Lopez. More info (in Spanish) can be found at  <a href="http://www.30anios.org.ar/">www.30anios.org.ar</a>, one of the organizers of the march. 

18 of October: a month after 77 year-old Jorge Julio Lopez disappeared, a key witness in the recent trial against  former police official Miguel Etchecolatz, who was sentenced last month to life imprisonment for his involvement in the last dictatorship in Argentina.

At one point during the demonstration I turned away from the crowd and saw a person in a black hood spray painting the words "Donde esta Lopez?" on the walls of the Cabildo. If you look closely at the photo, you can see the layers of white paint that covers graffiti from past demonstrations. Four policmen stood just within the closed gate of the Cabildo, clearly knowing that it's easier to re-paint the Cabildo than try and stop the vandalism.

 A few minutes earlier, across the street, a couple of girls sprayed a stencil on the walls of the Palacio de Gobierno de la Ciudad. The city used to station a line of riot police in front of that building but, this year, the city seems to have pulled most of the police away from that area during the demonstrations.  

This particular march was not quite the carnival that was the march of a couple of weeks ago that also focused on the disappearance of Lopez. I still need to do a write up on that one.

The crowd last night was quite different. I didn't stay to see  the entire protest line, which stretched quite far, but last night's demonstrations didn't have the mass of poor residents bused in from the provinces.  Overall, last night's crowd was more middle class and working class than a lot of the demonstrations. There also was an extremely large number of students.
