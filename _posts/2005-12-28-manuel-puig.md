Over the past couple of days I&#8217;ve been casting about for a book to read and then realized that today, December 28, would have been Manuel Puig&#8217;s seventy-third birthday. So I&#8217;ve decided to pick up <b>Kiss of the Spider Woman</b> (<b>El Beso la Mujer Arana</b>).

Manuel Puig, who died in 1990 at the age of 57, is one of the few Argentine writers to achieve wide-spread international recognition, mostly for the 1985 film version of this novel. Nominated for four Academy Awards, William Hurt received an Oscar for Best Actor.  After Puig&#8217;s death the novel/movie became a Broadway musical and won seven Tony awards. 

Puig was a child of the pampas, born in 1932 in General Villegas which sits on the western edge of Buenos Aires province. It&#8217;s fitting that Puig&#8217;s fame came from a movie since cinema formed the most significant influence on his writings. His early aspirations were actually to be a filmmaker and he moved to Rome to study cinema.   

His first novel <b>Betrayed by Rita Hayworth</b> (<b>La Tracion de Rita Hayworth</b>) is about the movies and people&#8217;s lives in rural Argentina.  His second novel <b>Boquitas pintadas</b>, translated into English as <b>Heartbreak Tango</b>, also was about life in his hometown in the pampas. 

In an <a href="http://www.centerforbookculture.org/interviews/interview_puig.html">interview</a>  Puig talks about writing:

<blockquote>
I write novels because there is something I don&#8217;t understand in reality. What I do is locate that special problem in a character and then try to understand it. That&#8217;s the genesis of all my work. Because of my unconscious defenses, I am incapable of facing the problem directly. There are obstacles that impede me from doing so. Yet I can do it through a literary character. It&#8217;s easier! And since all of my problems are rather complicated, I need an entire novel to deal with them, not a short story or a movie. It&#8217;s like a personal therapy. There is no freedom in that election. It&#8217;s not that I choose to do it, but that I&#8217;m forced to. It has to be a novel because I need a lot of space. It&#8217;s an analytical activity, not a synthetic one. 
</blockquote>

Puig was fortunate in having very good English translators. Four of his less well-known novels are translated by Suzanne Jill Levine, who also has translated many works by Adolfo Bioy Casares. Personally, I think that Levine is one of the best Spanish-English literary translators around. She also was a friend of Puig and in 2001 published a biography of him, <b>Manuel Puig and the Spider Woman</b>. I&#8217;ve not read this biography yet but it sounds like a superb study. 
 
In a New York Times <a href="http://partners.nytimes.com/books/00/08/13/reviews/000813.13vargast.html">review by Mario Vargas Llosa of Levine&#8217;s biography</a>, Vargas Llosa says about Puig, "He was a man of movies, or perhaps of visual images and fantasy, who found himself shipwrecked in literature almost by default.&#8221; It&#8217;s really a very good essay by Vargas Llosa and if you have any interest in literature then you should go read it.  But I&#8217;m not yet read enough of Puig to know whether I agree or not with Vargas Llosa conclusion that "Puig&#8217;s work may be the best representative of what has been called light literature, which is emblematic of our time &#8221;“ an undemanding, pleasing literature that has no other purpose than to entertain.&#8221; That seems a little harsh. Afterall, not everybody can be Borges or Faulkner or even Vargas Llosa. 

After the publication of Puig&#8217;s third novel <b>The Buenos Aires Affair</b> in 1973 and the rise of the military dictatorship, Puig left Argentina for the remainder of his life. Puig&#8217;s literary style   is mostly dialogue, reflective of the cinema.   He wasn&#8217;t afraid to incorporate popular culture and mass media into his stories. Homosexuality also was an instrumental theme in his works. 

I was surprised to learn that  another book by Puig <b>Eternal Curse on the Reader of these Pages</b> actually was written by Puig in English first and then translated into Spanish as <b>Maladicion Eterna a Quien Lea Estas Paginas</b>.  So, with that work, English-only readers have a chance to read Puig in the original and not a translation for once. 

From Kiss of the Spider Woman (Thomas Colchie, trans.):

"'we've realized the most difficult thing of all,' what's the most difficult thing of all to realize? 'That I live deep inside your thoughts and so I'll always remain with you, you'll never be alone...this dream is short but this dream is happy.'"
