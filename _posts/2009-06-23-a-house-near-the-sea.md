Ceci & I launched a new phase of our Buenos Aires adventures today with the purchase of a house in <a href="http://mardelsud.wordpress.com/">Mar del Sud</a>

We're not totally abandoning the city life for a cottage by the sea...at least, not yet...and this blog will continue at its recent sporadic space...but future postings also will include an occasional mention of our new home out along the coast of Buenos Aires province.

If you're not familiar with the charm of Mar del Sud (also known as Mar del Sur), then take a look at the <a href="http://www.maximagenes.com.ar/Galerias/galeria08/">fantastic photos of Mar del Sur by Max Gioffre</a>. He has some really great photos.
