Ok, this will be the last in my recent postings about demolished houses and new construction in Barracas. That is, unless I come across some other ridiculousness as I'm walking around tomorrow.

So, here on Av Montes de Oca was this building. Nothing extraordinary but nice, very pleasant. (The photo is again from the city's mapping site, taken a few years back).

The future site of construction project by a Spanish real estate developer.

And what's up with that hideous blue paint job on the ground floor of the building next door?
