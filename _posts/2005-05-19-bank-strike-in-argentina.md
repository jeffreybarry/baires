Employees of all the banks in Argentina went on strike today.  With the exception of one small scuffle with the Police in front of the Casa Rosada, this was a mild demonstration by Argentine standards.  Afterall, how radical can bankers be? The employees are calling for banks to respect the 7.5 hour working day and a 30% wage increase.  The strike was scheduled only to last for one day.
