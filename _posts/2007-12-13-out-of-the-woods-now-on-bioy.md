<a href="http://outofthewoodsnow.blogspot.com/">Out of the Woods Now</a> is one of those good literary blogs you should be reading if you're interested in such things...A <a href="http://outofthewoodsnow.blogspot.com/2007/12/bioy-casares-invention.html">posting from earlier this week is on <strong>The Invention of Morel</strong> by Adolfo Bioy Casares</a>:


<blockquote>Any discussion of the plot would detract from the experience of encountering it for the first time, but suffice it to say that it involves obsession, immortality, fame, love, the parallel destinies of men and the images they create, and a woman named Faustine (which made me think of Goethe and deals with the devil). The invention itself is something we're on the verge of today--I was stunned when I flipped to the copyright page and discovered that it was first published in 1940 (!).</blockquote>
