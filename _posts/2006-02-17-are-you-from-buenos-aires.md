Santiago in Brooklyn, who appears to be a transplanted porte&#241;o, has a funny posting titled <a href="http://spanishstudies.blogspot.com/2006/01/are-you-from-buenos-aires.html">Are you from Buenos Aires?</a> with a list of <em>You know you're a porte&#241;o when</em>:

- Nothing is good anymore, it's <em>b√°rbaro</em>
- You can walk the entire length of Florida without being heckled once by a money-changer or flyer distributor
-  You think nothing of hopping on a bus for 15 hours to get away for the weekend
- You don't find it surprising that 2 of these hours are spent leaving the city
