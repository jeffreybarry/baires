Ian over at GoodAirs has a good post about the <a href="http://www.goodairs.com/2007/11/out-with-old.html">demolition of old houses in Palermo</a> to make way for more apartment towers. The post fits in well with my ongoing <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/the-city-that-fades-away/">The City that Fades Away</a> series. 

Ian writes



<blockquote>Since we've moved to our PH in Palermo, at least four beautiful, albeit battered, old buildings have been sold. One has already been knocked down and replaced with a seven-floor anono-tower. Another two more are set to be demolished soon. So when I saw the signs for a auction of the interior finishings in the above building, I had to go.</blockquote>

See <a href="http://www.goodairs.com/2007/11/out-with-old.html">his post for more</a>, including some photos from the interior of a soon to be gone part of Buenos Aires.
