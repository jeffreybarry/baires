I've been working recently with part-time Buenos Aires resident <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/a-conversation-with-peter-robertson/">Peter Robertson</a> to help get <a href="http://www.interlitq.org/">Issue 2 of the International Literary Quarterly</a> ready.  There is some really wonderful writing in this issue, so if you're into literature then you must check it out.

While I'm on the topic of international literature and journals, I want to point out an e-journal that I had an instrumental role in launching in 2003 when I ran the digital library initiatives at the University of Miami -  <a href="http://anthurium.miami.edu/">Anthurium: A Caribbean Studies Journal</a>.
