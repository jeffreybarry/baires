<a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/puerto-madero/">My thoughts on Puerto Madero</a> are know to regular readers of this site. Lately I've been doing a lot of work, spending most of my days, in one of those office buildings along the waterway. 

What I didn't previously realize is that some of those buildings have nice rooftop patios, nice spots for lunch. If you work in this area then it's best to bring your own lunch since the area is filled with overpriced and not so good restaurants. I noticed this week that a Hooters has opened in Puerto Madero. That must be a sign that the economy is recovering. (Wasn't there one in Village Recoleta a few years back?) 

Anyway, the rooftop terrace makes for a nice view so I thought I would post a photo since few people get to see the area from that angle.
