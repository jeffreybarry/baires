If you take the bus in Buenos Aires, which you should do sometime, you will have discovered that some of the bus stops are hard to find. Some bus stops, like for the #10, are indicated by no more than a little sticker slapped on a utility pole. Over the last year I've been observing this bus stop sign that is being slowed enveloped by a tree. Earlier this month I finally got around to taking a photo.

Actually, I don't think that this stop is still in service. It's on Av Chile near Puerto Madero and just around just around the corner from an interesting set of abandoned buildings that <a href="http://www.wrighton.com.ar/?p=730">Robert talks about over at <em>line of sight</em></a>. 


Look closely at the top of the sign and notice how the tree is pushing the letter "R" off the sign.
