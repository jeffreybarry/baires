My posting here has slowed down a little in the past couple of days as I start-up another blog <a href="http://elsur.org">El Sur, Travel in South America</a>. That site will be mainly information about tourism related topics for those visiting South America. Daily, I run across so many Web sites and issues that are broader than just Buenos Aires, so I wanted to have a place to  collect that information. The postings there will generally be shorter and less personal than the ones here.
