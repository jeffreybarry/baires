The good folks at <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/index.php">Three Percent</a> have a couple of mentions about Argentine writer Rodolfo Fogwill whose novel <em>Los Pichiciegos</em> has just been released in English (translated by Nick Caistor and Amanda Hopkinson): <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1852429658?ie=UTF8&tag=elsur-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1852429658">Malvinas Requiem: Visions of an Underground War</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=elsur-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1852429658" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

<a href="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/index.php?id=495">Three Percent points</a> to a piece in the Guardian which describes Fogwill's book as "<a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/10/catch_of_the_day_malvinas_requ.html">the definitive fictionalised account of the Falklands conflict</a>".

Rather interesting is <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/index.php?id=496">a comparison of marketing material written for the U.S. and U.K. markets</a>. Along the way are mentioned Bioy Casares and the TV show <em>Lost</em>. Now, I'm interested in digging up the  ways that <em>Los Pichiciegos</em> was marketed here in Argentina.
