Barracas isn't just a bunch of <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/old-factories-in-barracas/">old factories</a>. There are also some very nice houses there, such as this place on a cobblestone street. 

<div style="width:145px;text-align:right;"><a href="http://beta.zooomr.com/photos/14048@Z01/494090/" title="Zooomr Photo Sharing :: Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.zooomr.com/images/494090_a781276c59_m.jpg" width="145" height="240" alt="barracasHouse" border="0" style="border:1px solid #000;" /></a></div>

Of course, I guess some people would not want to live across the street from some old, brick garage but I think it has quite a bit of charm.
