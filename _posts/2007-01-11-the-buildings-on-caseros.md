A message from a good friend of mine from college who is now an architect prompts me to write about the buildings on the street where I live in Buenos Aires. (Shout out to Jim!).

The city has been doing a lot of work on this street, new sidewalks and strip of grass planted down the center. Well, the median is still mostly dirt but notice the new old-fashion street lights that now grace Avenida Caseros.

Our building is the one on the right in the photo above. Below is another photo, a closer shot. Long-time readers also may remember a post about <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/moved-to-a-new-apartment/">when we moved to this place</a> last year that features photos of the interior.

I don't really care for the black trim around the windows, a little funereal for me, but the building is outstanding. Almost all the buildings on this part of Caseros are very interesting. Most are in good shape, though there are still a few that need a lot of work.

I'm going to have more to say about that building in the background of the top photo.
