During the big football games I'm accustom to hearing cheers from the streets whenever there is a goal. But when Argentina scored its first goal this morning against Serbia-Montenegro I didn't expect to hear the church bells ringing from Santa Catalina outside the street from my apartment.  Considering that Argentina scored 5 more goals, it amounted to a lot of ringing. I'm not complaining. It's just another part of the World Cup experience in Buenos Aires. 

<strong>Added</strong>: The Guardian has a humorous <a href="http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/minbymin/0,,1788276,00.html">minute-by-minute account</a> of the game complete with fans email comments. (Mostly by fans of England; Argentine football fans will enjoy the article):



<blockquote>

<em> 29 mins - Argentina 2 - 0 Serbia and Montenegro</em>: How the f**k am I supposed to describe that? <strong>The goal of the tournament so far and quite possibly the greatest goal I've ever seen.</strong>

<em>31 mins</em>: Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Ping. Back-heel from Crespo. Cambiasso ... goal!

With 24 short, high speed passes, the blurry shapes that are assorted Argentina players carve open Serbia and Montengro, before Cambiasso pulls the trigger from the edge of the penalty area. The Serbia and Montenegro players were left standing like statues they were so mesmerised. <strong>Make it your business to see that goal - it was unbelievably good.</strong>
