Two years ago I wrote a <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/maurycy-minkowski-a-nearly-forgotten-artist/">post about Maurycy Minkowski</a>, a Polish-Jewish artist whose life came to a tragic end shortly after arriving in Buenos Aires. Earlier this month I finally had a chance to see some actual paintings by Minkowski at the <em>Jewish Museum</em> at Libertad 769.

This is not a very good photograph. As I was taking it I could feel the presence of the guy coming up behind me to tell me not to take photos. Anyway, I just love this painting, the expressiveness of the faces.
