I try to look in, even briefly, on the blogs by travelers to Buenos Aires.  Most cover the same familiar territory, some offer helpful tips for the tourists, and then there are those offering a fresh perspective. Occasionally, a rather famous name (depending upon your definition of fame) might be blogging about Buenos Aires. Last year there was <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/david-byrne-on-buenos-aires-argentina/">David Byrne blogging about his trip to Argentina</a>. Today, I came across <a href="http://robertfulghum.com/index.php/fulghumweb/entry/500_a_letter_home/">a delightful series of postings by Robert Fulghum</a>, known for his enormously popular books, particularly <strong>All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten</strong>.



<blockquote>The dominant theme in my mind for months has been the dream of Argentina and tango. From experience I know that whatever you imagine a new country to be, reality will adjust your imagination. What is in the guide books is all too often a description of a Disney World that exists only for tourists who will be satisfied with illusions. It is best to be prepared to be disappointed by what you anticipate, surprised by what you encounter, and delighted by what you find.

So, then, how is BsAs and tango, you may ask? I will tell you. In the form of the South American literary tradition of magic realism, The Tango Chronicles of Senor Don Roberto Juan Carlos Fuljumero y Suipacha. You may draw your own conclusions. </blockquote>
