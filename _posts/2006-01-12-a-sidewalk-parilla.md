Ever since moving to San Telmo I've noticed this man every weekday on calle Piedras. He brings the grill and has his own little restaurant on the sidewalk in front of the signs covering an old, abandoned building. Some days he even has a bottle of wine, along with glasses, for his customers who want a drink. Just another one of those unexpected things that you encounter on the streets of Buenos Aires. <br />
