This appeared on the front wall of the Cabildo during Friday night's march. More graffiti that appeared on the Cabildo that night can be found on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffbarry/">my flickr pages</a>. I've not used flickr much, so I don't have things organized very well on there yet.  For this posting, I tried flickr's "blog this" feature, which allows you to blog directly from your flickr account to your own blog...it worked pretty well! May have to make more use of that.
