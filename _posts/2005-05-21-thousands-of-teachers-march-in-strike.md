I got up early today, 11am, because I knew that the teachers union - CTERA - was planning a large march to the Congreso at midday. Across Argentina, 95% of the teachers went on strike today. 

This was the first strike by the teachers in the two years of KirchnerÂ´s presidency of Argentina. Union organizers estimated over 10,000 people participated in the march. Not all were teachers, as I noticed some piquetero groups at the end of the march. But thatÂ´s okay, thereÂ´s solidarity in the social movements here. 

The teachers are demanding that the government financing for education be increased to 3% of the Gross National Product. Currently, educational funding is at 3%.
