I stumbled across this excellent essay by David Rock titled <a href="http://www.newleftreview.net/NLR25104.shtml">Racking Argentina</a> that provides a solid background for understanding today's current economic conditions in Argentina. 

David Rock is the leading English-language historian of Argentina and his work always has an economic slant to it. While written in 2002 before the election of Kirchner, the article is still timely as David Rock  puts the situation into a global context, explaining how economic conditions in various parts  of the world impacted the Argentine economy.  He also points out critical mistakes by the government: "During the Menem years, investment potential remained largely in the imagination of the president&#8217;s advertising team."
