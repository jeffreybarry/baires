Just an update on some writing things involving some expats that have a home in Buenos Aires....

Peter Robertson & I have released the latest issue of <a href="http://interlitq.org/"><em>The International Literary Quarterly</em></a>. Lots of good poetry, stories, & essays in this issue.

Maya Frost is on a tour of the U.S. to promote her book "<em>The New Global Student: Skip the SAT, Save Thousands on Tuition, and Get a Truly International Education</em>".  Follow <a href="http://www.mayafrost.com/blog/">Maya's blog</a> for updates from the road. I'm enjoying her video interviews with her editor, agent, & others.

A huge congrats out to Ellen Bryson for signing with the highly respected <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/HenryHolt.aspx">Henry Holt & Co</a> to publish her debut novel <em>Hungry</em> next year. We're very excited about that.

I'm sure there are a lot of others out there writing and publishing, but those are just a few I know personally. If anyone knows other expats in Argentina that are publishing, please leave comments and links.
