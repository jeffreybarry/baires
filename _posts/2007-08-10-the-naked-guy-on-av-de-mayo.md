I never tire of walking down Av de Mayo. Even though I've walked the avenue many times, I always gain a new perspective. Perhaps it's just observing the porte&#241;os wandering back-and-forth or the way the day's sunlight strikes the outstanding architecture. Along the 1300 block the Barolo pulls my eye up towards its heights, then my gaze drifts over to admire La Inmobiliaria. I've repeated this pattern dozens of times over the last few years. 

Yesterday I did a double take, as for the first time, I noticed these gleaming figures atop La Inmobiliaria.

For the last couple of years the building has been undergoing a slow renovation. Usually I'm focused on other aspects of La Inmobiliaria, like its distinctive red cupolas or the loggia. I have never noticed the shiny naked guy as much as now. From what material are these statues made? From a distance,  so bright, it seems like bronze or were they covered with some metallic paint?  I'm curious, especially when comparing the other statues on the same building.

On the front of the building you'll find the same pair, same pose, but this time not looking so happy and shiny. Supposedly, the pair are Apollo and Venus.

The corner facing Congreso was refurbished some time ago but this pair didn't get the bronzer. This time she's naked and he's dressed. Look closely and notice how the two are coyly admiring each other. What's going on up there?
