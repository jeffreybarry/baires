Searching for that perfect book in English during your stay in Buenos Aires? The good folks over at <a href="http://argentinastravel.com">Argentina's Travel</a> brings you "<a href="http://argentinastravel.com/pocket-guides/bookstore-guide/">Buenos Aires' Brilliant Bookstores: Finding BA's Best English-language Book Selections</a>."

As a literary type I spend way too much on books. Even when I was a librarian and had access to a library of millions of books, I still spent about us$50 a week on my own books and magazines. (My book budget is now a lot lower, down to around 50 pesos a month).

The guide to English-language bookstores, written by Natalie Gourvitch, starts off with my favorite: <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/walrus-books/">Walrus Books</a>, which has the best selection of English-language literary fiction in Buenos Aires.

My criteria of quality for evaluating articles about bookstores in Buenos Aires includes examining what is said about <strong>El Ateneo Grand Splendid</strong>. Yep, it's a beautiful place but it's actual inventory isn't great. Natalie writes, "While El Ateneo, as is true for chain
stores like Cuspide and Distal, is great for finding popular romance/thriller novels with a spattering of Shakespeare thrown in for good measure, it lacks a large selection of classics and quality modern fiction titles." I assume that she's talking about the English-language books but I never been very pleased with El Ateneo's selection of Spanish-language titles, either. I go there all the time to browse around but rarely do I buy anything there.

I'm reminded of my quest last year: <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/searching-for-galeano-in-the-bookstores-of-buenos-aires/">Searching for Galeano in the bookstores of Buenos Aires</a>, a odd tale in which it was actually easier to find books in English translations than in the original Spanish.
