This afternoon at the caf√© I read a book review which proceeded to tell me way more than I wanted to know about the book prior to reading it. I immediately remembered why I seldom read reviews of books that I want to read. And long ago <strong>I've learned never to read movie reviews</strong>. I rather approach things like this without much prior knowledge, just arming myself with only a vague notion of the story. 

The amount you know about something beforehand certainly impacts your experience. But does it <strong>enhance or hinder</strong> your experience?

Likewise, what about the ways we experience a place, a city such as Buenos Aires?

Obviously the parallels are not the same. But I'm curious as to <strong>what type of reading, what type of learning experience, enhances our travels? And what type of reading actually hinders our experience?</strong>
