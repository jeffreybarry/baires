There are many <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/30-things-to-do-when-visiting-buenos-aires/">fun things to do in Buenos Aires</a> and, on this Valentine's Day, here are some ways of falling in love with the city of Buenos Aires:

<ol>
	<li> Enjoy the afternoon on a shady bench in Plaza San Martín, with a backdrop of aristocratic palaces and the periodic appearance of historically dressed <em>militars </em>marching towards the Malvinas memorial. </li>
	<li> Hunting down the distinctive garages, those characteristic structures from the city's golden age that remarkably stylize the concept of the parking lot.</li>
	<li> Spend hours in a classic café talking with a friend, reading, or just observing porte&#241;o society.</li>
	<li> Linger along the streets, admiring architectural details, like decorative tiles and stunning doorways, designed and crafted by architects and contractors who proudly left their names on the facades. </li>
	<li> Venture away from the busy avenues and stroll down cobblestone streets in a quiet barrio, where you might even unexpectedly stumble onto a film set.</li>
	<li> Witness the seductive dance of tango in a <em>milonga</em>, or join in if your feet allow.	</li>
	<li> Seek out an antique pocket watch in a charming store on a hidden block in the city's core.</li>
<li> Discover Argentina's many great painters- Berni, Quinquela Martín, Xul Solar - and wonder why you've never heard their names before coming to know Buenos Aires.</li>
<li> Wander down a side street between Puerto Madero and downtown and be astonished at the sight of an eternal flame below a painting of the mythical figure of Eva Perón that adorns one corner building. </li>
<li> Walk the streets of Buenos Aires, just choose a street and walk....walk slow.</li>
</ol>

If you want to fall in love with Buenos Aires, or already are in a passionate affair with this city, I will be releasing a series of e-books that I'm labeling the <em><strong>Walking Buenos Aires</strong> series</em>. Each e-book also will be available in a print format for those of you who prefer your books on paper. The first volume will be out soon. Stay updated on this series by heading over to <a href="http://walkingbuenosaires.com">walkingbuenosaires.com</a> and leaving your email address.
