I've <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/feliz-cumpleanos-mercedes-sosa/">written before</a> about the great voice of Mercedes Sosa. Now via youtube you can see and hear <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyOJ-A5iv5I">Mercedes Sosa performing the beautiful "Gracias a la vida"</a>. 

The performance must be about 25 or 30 years ago but her voice is still as good today as it was then. The quality of this video is very good. Also, for the Spanish impaired, there are subtitles to the lyrics. While the subtitles are in Spanish you should be able to figure out the meaning of the <a href="http://www.mercedessosa.com.ar/cancionero/letras/gracias.htm">lyrics of "Gracias a la vida"</a>.  The song was written by the Chilean Violeta Parra, who committed suicide in 1967. National Geographic has a <a href="http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/worldmusic/view/page.basic/artist/content.artist/violeta_parra">brief bio of Violeta Parra</a> on its world music site. 

Enjoy!
