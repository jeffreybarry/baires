"<strong>He understood that the task of molding the incoherent and dizzying stuff that dreams are made of is the most difficult work a man can undertake</strong>." [Comprendió que el empe&#241;o de modelar la materia incoherente y vertiginosa de que se componen los sue&#241;os es el más arduo que puede acometer un varón.]

"The Circular Ruins" is my favorite story by Borges. The imagery leads to an ultimately terrifying revelation about reality.  

The last five words of "The Circular Ruins" may have you deciding to re-read the entire story.
