Andres Oppenheimer, columnist for the Miami Herald, and a native of Argentina, has an<a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/columnists/andres_oppenheimer/13066995.htm?source=rss&channel=miamiherald_andres_oppenheimer"> interesting perspective on the Maradona-led rally against the visit of George Bush</a> to Argentina this week:

<blockquote>
It's sad to see that Argentina's left, which suffered a dictatorship only three decades ago, can't protest against Bush without embracing Castro. They seem to have forgotten that there is no such thing as a good dictator.

It sets a bad precedent for this country: Today they admire Castro, tomorrow they may embrace another ''savior of the fatherland'' who could jail peaceful oppositionists at home.
</blockquote>

I'm certainly no supporter of Bush and I'm not a fan of Castro, either.  And I'm going to try not to comment on Peron, who is still very admired in this country.  But Argentina's history is full of authoritarian governments and it seems that the climate here is right for another one to develop.
