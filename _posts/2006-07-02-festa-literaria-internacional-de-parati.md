Someday we'll make it up to Brazil to attend the <a href="http://www.flip.org.br/index1.php3">Festa Literária Internacional de Parati</a>, which surely must be one of the world's great literary festivals. The festival, August 9 -13, will open with a concert by Maria BethÃ¢nia. According to the just released <a href="http://www.flip.org.br/programa.php3">festival program</a>, it looks like a great few days. The main international star of this year's festival is Toni Morrison. 

I'm mentioning the festival on the Baires blog because one of the participating authors is <strong>Ricardo Piglia</strong>, who will speak at a talk titled <em>The Last Reader</em>:

 

<blockquote>Can literary criticism be a form of autobiography? This is what Argentine writer Ricardo Piglia asks in his exquisite reflections on the great works of literature. "Writing fiction changes the way we read, and a writer&#8217;s criticism raises a secret mirror to his own work,&#8221; he claims in Formas breves. For this extraordinary event, Argentina&#8217;s most celebrated novelist and literary essayist, author of Respiración artificial and El ultimo lector, will consider the extent to which his forays into literary criticism are a reflection of his own very private reading history.</blockquote>

The festival is actually quite affordable. No doubt thanks to festival president <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1518428,00.html">Liz Calder</a>, one of the founders of  the publisher Bloomsbury. Costs for the opening concert and each of the author's readings is 17 reais, which is about 8 dollars.
