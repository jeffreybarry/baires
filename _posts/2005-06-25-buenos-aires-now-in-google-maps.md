I've been waiting for the appearance of South America in <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>. The fun is no longer just limited to North America!

<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=-34.642982,-58.462372&spn=0.178528,0.253372&t=k&hl=en" target="_blank">As you can see in this satellite photo</a>, Buenos Aires is really a rather small town.

My own little corner of Buenos Aires is <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=-34.599380,-58.400992&spn=0.005579,0.007918&t=k&hl=en" target="_blank">here on Avenida CÃ³rdoba</a>, just left of center on this photo. That's the medical facility of the Universidad de Buenos Aires situated around Plaza Houssay on the upper right-side.
