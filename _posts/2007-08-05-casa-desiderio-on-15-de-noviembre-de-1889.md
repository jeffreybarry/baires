Few people venture along the side streets behind Constituci√≥n station but there are some pleasant surprises (and I'm not talking about the transvestite prostitutes, though there are indeed plenty of trany hookers - or is the word "transy"?). 

If you walk around the area on a bright sunny day you'll see that it's not so bad, hardly the red light district that some imagine. There's actually some interesting architecture in the area and this post continues my series on <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/the-city-that-fades-away/">the city that fades away</a>.

This photo, taken late last year, is of a building facade on a street named <em>15 de Noviembre de 1889</em> that starts just behind the train station.
