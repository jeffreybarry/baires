I'm about to head out of town for a week without Internet and computer, yeah! But before I leave I want to mention the first title in the <a href="http://walkingbuenosaires.com">Walking Buenos Aires</a> book series: <strong>4 Picture-Perfect Days in Buenos Aires</strong>. 

This new guidebook, of sorts, to Buenos Aires will be available at the end of this month. We're working on the page layout now and here's a brief snapshot of some pages:

Later titles in the series, coming out about one new title every two or three months, will focus more in-depth on different characteristics of the city. 

To stay updated with announcements about this series of books, you can head over to <a href="http://walkingbuenosaires.com">walkingbuenosaires.com</a> and leave your e-mail address. Many of you already have done so and <em>Thanks!</em>
