My sister and her daughters are in town visiting for a while. Yesterday they were wandering along Florida street and brought some cookies back to the apartment. After looking at the label I realized that the cookies were by fellow <a href="http://azucaryespecies.blogspot.com/">BA blogger, Frank</a> of <a href="http://www.sugarandspice.com.ar/">Sugar & Spice</a>. 

We had the oatmeal raisin cookies...superb!

If you haven't tried these cookies, then go find some. Meanwhile, read the <a href="http://azucaryespecies.blogspot.com/2007/04/la-nacin-interview.html">interview that La Naci√≥n recently did with Frank</a>.
