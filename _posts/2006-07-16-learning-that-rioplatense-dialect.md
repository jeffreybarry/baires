Laura has a   good posting about <a href="http://movingtoargentina.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/07/learning_spanis.html">learning Spanish</a> and the dialect used around Buenos Aires. It reminded me about a project at the University of Iowa, <a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/~acadtech/phonetics/#">Phonetics: The Sounds of English, German, and Spanish</a>. If you have problems figuring out exactly where to put your tongue when trying to speak any of these languages, the Phonetics site has some very good instructions, complete with a flash-based diagram and  online audio and video of a person speaking the sound.

I was impressed that the site not only has the rioplatense dialect but also the caribe&#241;o. In Miami I had a much more difficult time understanding Cuban speakers. The University of Iowa site showed why.

The Iowa site is good for those also learning American English, though I don't think that they got all those ancient Southern diphtongs that we use back in Tennessee! 


There are now quite a number of audio resources on the net now for learning different accents and dialects. I'll try to post some more links as I come across them.
