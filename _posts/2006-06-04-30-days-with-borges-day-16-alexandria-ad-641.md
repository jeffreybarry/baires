Libraries, labyrinths, and the fact that anything is ever written are constant themes in the works of poems. Here are a few lines from the poem "Alexandria, A.D. 641". The date refers to the year that the great library at Alexandria was destroyed. 

<b>
Unceasing human work gave birth to this<br />
Infinity of books. If of them all<br />
Not even one remained, man would again<br />
Beget each page and every line,<br />
Each work and every love of Hercules,<br />
And every teaching of every manuscript. 
</b>

Las vigilias humanas engendraron<br />
Los infinitos libros. Si de todos<br />
No quedara uno solo, volverían<br />
A engendrar cada hoja y cada línea,<br />
Cada trabajo y cada amor de Hércules,<br />
Cada lección de cada manuscrito.


Towards the end of the poem, in typical Borges fashion, it is revealed that the first person narrator of "Alexandria, A.D. 641"  is Caliph Omar,  who ordered the destruction of the library. Yet, the concept of continually rebuilding the "infinity of books" also  stands outside   the history of the library of Alexandria and re-appears in several of other works by Borges.
