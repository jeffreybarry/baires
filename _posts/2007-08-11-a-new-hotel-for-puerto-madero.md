There's a new hotel that has been going up over the last year near Puerto Madero. It's not on the level of competing with the Hilton or the Faena but could offer business travelers an alternative. The hotel is situated not quite in Puerto Madero but at the corner of Chile and Azopardo, which is not a bad tree-lined area. 

The oddest thing about the hotel is its name: Hotel Park Plaza K.

<strong>Plaza K? </strong> In Argentina these days most people associate "K" with Kirchner. Maybe the K stands for Kempinski, the hotel chain, but it seems a strange choice for a hotel name in Argentina.
