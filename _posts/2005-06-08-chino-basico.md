In English there's the expression, "It's Greek to me" in reference to something that the speaker has no way of comprehending. In Spanish, or at least the way it's practiced in Argentina, the same concept is expressed "Chino básico" which is figuratively translated as "It's Chinese to me" though the more literary (not literally) translation in English would probably be just "It's Greek to me." I did just a quick bit of research and it seems that a number of languages refer to this concept by referencing the Chinese rather than the Greek. I don't want to get into a linguistic issue here, just wanted to throw that "Chino básico" expression out there.
