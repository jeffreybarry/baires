On the ground floor of the building where I formerly lived, there was a shoe store that had been in business since 1940. Everyone who worked inside was quite old. (The same was true for most of the shoes, it seemed). Over the weekend I walked by the building again and saw that the store had finally gone out of business.

So, now there's a nice store for rent on Av Brasil at the edge of San Telmo. There's a lot of traffic on that street (believe me, I heard it all from my bedroom three floors above the shoe store!) but, it's one of those areas that is no longer well suited for a store. I suspect the store - like some others nearby - will stay vacant for a very long time. 

Anyway, farewell to the shoe merchants...sixty-six years is a mighty good run.
