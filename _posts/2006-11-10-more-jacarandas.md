Robert's posting about <a href="http://www.wrighton.com.ar/?p=512">Buenos Aires in bloom</a> inspired me to walk over to Parque Lezama and take a look at the jacaranda trees which are so pretty this time of year. 

The city has been doing work on Parque Lezama so it's becoming nice. Quite a bit of grass has been added to the areas that had turned to dirt and dust. The park is best on a weekday, when it can be a relaxing spot. On the weekends it gets way too crowded and rather bizarre. 

I'm not really pleased with these photos. The exposure on the camera didn't want to cooperate. Anyway, the trees look much nicer in person.
