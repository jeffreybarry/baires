Sitting home on a quiet Sunday reading the newspapers, then there's all this noise outside...sirens, loudspeakers, drums...sounds like a demonstration of some sort, though Sunday is a strange day for that ...wander downstairs out to the street to see what's up...turns out to be a nice family event, kids celebrating their first communion on the feast day of St. Catherine, who rode a firetruck following the line of parents and priests.
