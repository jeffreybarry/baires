While browsing around a bookstore in San Telmo today I found a volume of photographs that fits perfectly with my <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/the-city-that-fades-away/">City that Fades Away</a> series: <em>Arquitecturas ausentes: obras notables demolidas en la ciudad de buenos aires</em>/Absent Architecture: Notable Works Demolished in the City of Buenos Aires.

As one can expect, there's quite a lot of Buenos Aires that is no longer with us. This book of over 100 black-and-white photographs was produced by <a href="http://www.elartenauta.com.ar/home.html">Marcelo Kohan</a> and the <em><a href="http://www.cedodal.com/">Centro de Documentación de Arquitectura Latinoamericana</a></em> (CEDODAL) here in Buenos Aires.

The cover image depicts the original Teatro Colón, then located just off of Plaza de Mayo. 

Each photo in the book includes the address and a short description of the building. There are some really remarkable works, including many images I've never seen before.  For any fan of Buenos Aires architecture, this is one for your collection. 

Here's a sample photo of Teatro Variedades that was located - where? - surprisingly, in front of Plaza de Constitución.

That's nice, isn't it?

Pick up a copy of the book to see the rest.
