The inactivity on this blog was largely due to my absence from Buenos Aires for 2010 & 2011. I spent that time down on the coast of Argentina in a very small place called Mar del Sur, which proved far too small. We then moved over a bit to the larger town of Miramar. (Oh, and along the way we had a baby girl.)

At the end of 2011 we moved back to Buenos Aires, but work and parenthood is keeping me busy. <strong>I'm not sure yet how I will continue writing about Buenos Aires</strong>. My experiences in the city are very different than six or seven years ago when this blog was in full swing. No longer is there time for those long, rambling walks around the city. I rarely get out of the neighborhood these days.

We'll see if I can return to an occasional presence on this blog.
