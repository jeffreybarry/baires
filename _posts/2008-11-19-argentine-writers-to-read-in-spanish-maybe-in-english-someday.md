Wandering the bookstores in Buenos Aires, looking for good fiction by an Argentine writer but you're already read enough of Borges, Bioy, & Cortazar? A local foundation has compiled a catalog of 30 writers. And thanks to <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/index.php">a blog in the U.S. devoted to literary translations</a>, you can download the excellent catalog prepared by <a href="http://www.typa.org.ar/">Fundación TyPA</a>: <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/index.php?id=1425">30 Great Authors from Argentina</a>. 

The PDF is in English and is being used to promote Argentine writers to an international audience and, hopefully, some more Argentine writers will end up with their works translated. 

Fundación TyPA does have a page on their web site about the recent presentation of this catalog, but oddly no link from their site to the actual catalog. If you don't want to download the PDF, they do provide <a href="http://www.typa.org.ar/fktautores.html">this list</a>. 

Happy reading!
