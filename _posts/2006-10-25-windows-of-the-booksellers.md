There's something about bookstores that attract me, perhaps the adventure of never knowing what waits inside. Buenos Aires is full of bookstores and, downtown, on the 800 block of Esmeralda are three charming bookstores: Poema 20, Libreria Anticuaria L'Amateur, and El Libro Frances.

These booksellers all specialize in titles that you're not likely to find elsewhere in the city. Whenever I get the chance, I try to stop by and gaze in the windows of these stores. Even when they're closed and the iron bars are drawn down over the glass, I enjoy lingering in front of these stores, looking at the titles on display.

An interesting literary side note is that Argentine writer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonsina_Storni">Alfonsina Storni</a> once lived down the street in the beautiful building on the corner of Esmeralda and CÃ³rdoba.
