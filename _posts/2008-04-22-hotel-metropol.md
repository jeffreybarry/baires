Another for the <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/the-city-that-fades-away/">City that Fades Away</a> series....

The <a href="http://basta-de-demoler.blogspot.com/">basta de demoler</a> blog chronicles the demolition of the historic architecture in Buenos Aires. Their posts this last week have been about the illegal demolition of yet another aspect of the city's cultural heritage, the former Hotel Metropol (Bartolom√© Mitre 1618/20).

You should take a look at <a href="http://basta-de-demoler.blogspot.com/2008/04/hotel-metropol-visita-guiada.html">this video that offers a tour of the interior</a>.
