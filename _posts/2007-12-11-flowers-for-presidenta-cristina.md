Yesterday I walked down to Av de Mayo to witness the inauguration day parade of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. Scores of buses that had carried people in from the province were lined up along the part of Av 9 de Julio south of Av Belgrano. If the Kirchners's hadn't bused in supporters then the crowd for the later fiesta in Plaza de Mayo would have been very small. It seems like most porte&#241;os found something better to do on a very pleasant afternoon. I'm a sucker for pomp and ceremony.

Even along Av de Mayo it was very easy to find a spot along the fence that the police had installed on Av de Mayo. For most of Av de Mayo  the crowd was only one person deep along the barricade. 

Coming along first was the colorful military unit on horseback along with their band. I've not seen these guys since <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/archives/peron-mania/">Perón's reburial</a>. They had a nice sound. I didn't bring a real video cam but caught a few seconds of grainy video with my Sony digital camera.

And here's the video of Cristina riding in the back of the car, waving, and asking one of her security detail to give her a rose tossed by the crowd.

I'm glad I went. Afterwards I made my way down to Plaza de Mayo for the <em>Fiesta de la Democracia</em>. Tomorrow's blog posting will have photos from the plaza.
