Having stayed up all night, I just finished reading Colm Toibin's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/0743250419&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=elsur-20&amp;creative=9325">The Master </a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=elsur-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0743250419" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, a powerful novel about Henry James.  What does that have to do with Buenos Aires? Well, nothing. 

But, Toibin is also the author of  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/0743272714&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=elsur-20&amp;creative=9325">The Story of the Night</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=elsur-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0743272714" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, which is set in Buenos Aires during the 1970s.  Toibin is an excellent writer, though I wasn't fond of <em>The Story of the Night</em>. The writing is very good but I got distracted by the subplot involving an American couple, the CIA, and Menem.   However, there's not that many English-language novels using Buenos Aires as the setting, so you might want to give this one by Toibin a try.
