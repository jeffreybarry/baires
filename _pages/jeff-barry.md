This blog captured some of the insight that I've learned in eight years of living in Buenos Aires (2005 - 2013). (Note: some photos are missing from postings.) 

I started this blog because I have a great interest in cultural heritage, the history of a place, the elements that form a city's identity. And those elements are not always in the past but evolve through our everyday lives. 


In March 2005, I left my university job in Miami and moved to Buenos Aires. For several years I was focused on writing and <a href="http://sorodesign.com">helping Cecilia with book design</a>.Â Then I focused on interactive digital storytelling, software development, and entrepreneurship.  In 2013 I returned to academia and moved back to the U.S. where I am an Associate Professor and Associate University Librarian at <a href="http://wlu.edu">Washington and Lee University</a>. 

You can read my short story <em>Forever Unaware</em> published in 2009 by <strong>Paradigm</strong> and Rain Farm Press. The original journal page is no longer, so I'm posting a <a href="http://baires.elsur.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/BarryForeverUnaware.pdf">copy of the story here</a>.

And here's a my piece of my flash fiction <a href="http://www.theshinejournal.com/jeffbarry.htm">Attachment to Insignificant Things</a>.

A story I wrote that is set in Buenos Aires: <a href="http://www.interlitq.org/issue21/jeff-barry/job.php">The Distraction of Living</a>.
